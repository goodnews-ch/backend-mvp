Here in NZ 50% of retailers don’t even have contactless credit card machines like pay-wave which support Apple Pay. They don’t like the high fees that come with these.,0
"I will forever acknowledge this channel with the help of your lessons and ideas explanations, Now It's quite helpful while you'll just sit at your comfort and monitor your account Growth.",1
"Whenever I go to a place that doesn’t take Apple Pay (doesn’t happen too often), it’s such a drag. Between ‘contactless Covid’ habits and my getting the Apple Card, I’ve gotten so used to Apple Pay that I get seriously annoyed when a store doesn’t take it. It feels like a shock, it’s crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine! I’ve officially been brainwashed by Apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical card in my pocket.",0
"Apple Pay is so convenient, secure, and easy to use. I used it while at the Korean and Japanese airports, no need for physical credit cards.",1
We only got Apple Pay in South Africa in 2020/2021 and it’s widely accepted.,1
"In the United States, we have an abundance of retailers that accept Apple Pay, but it's still good to carry the physical card with you, being there are still a large quantity of places that do NOT accept Apple Pay.",1
"Wow, you really went to town on the PSU test rack. That's a serious bit of kit. Very flexible, good choices. Wouldn't surprise me if Choma start offering this bespoke rack to the PSU makers. They all watch your videos, so they'll want to make sure it passes on this exact same rack. You can really push the industry here. Well done. Open source the test interface hardware and software.",1
The lab is the most exciting thing in IT I've seen for a while. This is reallly going to shake up how the qualiity of even basic components are manufactured.,1
"Linus, I'm an engineer and love the LMG content across all the channels.  Very much looking forward to more lab content and hope your engineering team will get more on camera time and hosting roles.",1
"There used to be a time where Linus was the smartest guy in the room, this video clearly shows that the team he has built are experts in their respective fields and make Linus look like a child. Kudos to Linus and LMG, you've grown beyond what I imagined. All the best!",1
Holy crap. I was looking at Chroma systems back when I was designing power supplies. Looks like you guys went all out! Re the multimeter: Most oscilloscopes are terrible for making accurate voltage measurements (8-10 bit ADCs). They are just for looking at the waveforms.,0
"I love the direction this channel is going. Most tech channels, even the best trusted ones are going to review products based on their own experience or at most some things they can measure with their pc, but you're really going to mathematically demonstrate if a product is a quality one and why it is, love it",1
"I am more excited for the LTT Lab than I have been for a lot of content for a while now. As everyone seems to be saying, it's exciting to see how enthusiastic this new crew is to get things running.",1
I adore the working relationship Linus has with his team. 99% of employees walk on eggshells around their boss and I wish it could be more like this.,1
"LMGs growth is honestly something to truly aspire for, this IS the content we want to watch. 

More technical, in depth, engineering oriented and science-based content will make us consumers much much more educated on these topics thus when picking a product not only will we pick the best choice but we'll know exactly why we picked it (which helps greatly with buyers remorse).",1
I love all the people LTT has added for labs. Clearly they're knowledgeable and passionate about tech! Labs is gonna be killer. Love it!,1
Linus!!! Just turn the key lights  180 and bounce them off the walls. You’ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting. It’s such a simple fix. I’m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face 😅,1
"Dan continues to be my new favorite, he has such an air of confidence about him and a comforting presence. Like Dan shows up and you just know things are going to be fine.",1
Dan managing to set up his soldering station on the one box they needed was incredibly amusing to me,1
"Linus: *Gets on his employee's cases for all the stuff stolen from the office*
Also Linus: *Proudly talks about all the stuff stolen from work he's using in his upgraded setup*

Linus: ""Why are you using this monitor as a table?""
Also Linus: *Uses the monitor as a chair* 

This video was hilarious",1
Dan the man. Saving the day. Riley needs to give him his own theme like Brian the Electrician.,1
"Dan continues to be a favourite for me. He's like the incredibly patient, but long-suffering Dad, who just gets on with things",1
"Dan is a treasure. Your channel has long lacked a Mr. fixit type and while I am sad it's not me, Dan appears quite capable and funny.",1
"Blows my mind how quickly Dan became the ""rock"" upon which all things Linus stands...Love it",1
"Hey Linus, a good trick for streaming lights: bounce them off the wall.  Much easier on the eyes, and a nice softer look.
Also, for indoors, I'd recommend a hyper-cardioid mic (looks like a short shotgun) like the Audio-Technica AT4053B.",1

"Everyone has been saying it but I’ll throw my hat in as well. To any prospective college students, you DO NOT need to spend money on flagship products. I am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a 7 year old laptop and the base iPad from late 2020. Both products have worked flawlessly and I have no intention of replacing them. The recommendations listed are ones I would never be able to afford even with my job I’m working as well. Do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is. I promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it.",1
"Shoutout to my OnePlus phone and Huawei laptop for getting me through university feeling premium for MUCH less. Bonus ups for Ikea's articulating lamps ($20 and I can see all my homework incredibly well without eye strain), the old door I refinished to use as a desktop, and wired earbuds under hardware store earmuffs as my ""noise-cancelling headphones."" And the same 2 sets of Hanes underwear from target for also lasting the whole ride.",1
"You don't necessarily need the high-end and latest tech for University.  I used a 2009 macbook pro throughout my years at uni , had an iphone 6 and it worked out just fine. What's important is to remain focused on getting that degree and graduating.",1
Personally I feel like this is really out of touch. Most students won't be able to afford these. In case anyone needs it: I believe Dave2D's back to school video are honestly the best ones I've seen on the topic. Consider checking them out too before making a purchase decision.,1
"Hey everyone. Good take on the video and love the recommendations. If you plan on making another video such as this, maybe you can also include some more budget options and best value options. 

What I can tell from my years of studying in college and university is that your tech and needs will be based on what courses/programme you took for your education.
Engineering students require computer specs that can run BIM software. I'm not sure about the other programmes but from what I can see that most students at my place has 8GB of RAM for their laptops.

Also, here is my setup during my university years. Hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their college/university years. All the best.

Laptop - ASUS X455L (Upgraded to SSD with additional RAM)
Phone - Vivo Y69/Redmi 10/Samsung A22 4G
Mouse - Logitech G102
Keyboard - Tecware TKL ver",1
"I have used Galaxy Tab S7 during my Ph.D. It's been a lifesaver for me. First of all, it is really good for reading journals, note taking and scribbling on the pdf's, secondly, it doesn't strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance, thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with Tab s7 and lastly if you are from a STEM background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams, you can draw those easily with the stylus on Tab s7. I choose tab s7 over Apple Ipad Air for its ease of use, user interface, and cost (you get stylus for free with Tab S7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount).",1
"This series is exactly what career day should've been, such interesting and knowledgeable people!",1

His face when describing hops killed me. “Some of them smell pretty… *Dank* “😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,0
"Seasoned craft brewery tour guide here, and I’m so glad he ended on “Drink what you like.” Sometimes people get weirdly judgmental about the beer preferences of others. At the end of the day, there are hundreds of beer styles for a reason, so everyone can find at least one style they actually like.",1
This guy is a total bro. Not snobby at all and just wants people to enjoy beer in whatever way they want. Such a contrast with your stereotypical beverage elitists.,1
Y’all be picking the literal best professionals for these videos. Not only is everyone knowledgeable but they all seem passionate and eager to teach us.,1

"Whenever we get people young enough to actually understand the internet, these giant tech companies might be broken up but as long as we have 90 year old senators asking tech CEOs how the internet works nothing will get done.",0
I live for John's roasts of AT&T.,1
Mad respect to John Oliver and his team for not making us watch ads during the show. Major props.,1
"One important aspect I'm surprised was left out is that many of these companies (like Amazon) literally power the internet. Almost 30% of the websites on the internet are stored on Amazon servers, giving them even more access to data trends and physical control over the internet.",1
"Back in 2018 when John Oliver did the episode on Corporate Consolidation it inspired me so much that I applied for a Masters of Research program, got into a program, and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies. It was shocking to see how bad it really is; oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant. My research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue. The answer was that it was truly both. I thoroughly enjoyed my pre-doctoral masters thesis and am considering a PhD in the future. It's so lovely to see John talk about this, specifically on the tech sector!

Edit: Wow! Thanks everyone for the great comments! I haven't published it yet, otherwise I would share it with all you lovely people ❤ I am now looking for a policy or qualitative research/analyst job so if anyone is hiring, let me know 😅",0

"Hey, something that might interest you. A couple of days ago my Amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time they're telling me it's for excessive returns which I think is an error but that's beside the point. When they closed my Amazon account all my Amazon devices that I own for years primarily all my Echo devices stopped working. I lost access to the Amazon Photos and Prime Video which I pay for. So apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by Amazon on your perceived shopping habits! I assume the same applies to all other Amazon devices and services like fire OS tablets, Ring cameras, and probably AWS as well. Just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely don't tell you this when you buy your hardware and services.",0
"Hey hey, just a heads up, I DID turn the LED Hoodie on, it's just not very bright hen you're looking face-on at it! (you can still sort of see it on around the hood area though)! 🙌

That was seriously the most enjoyable thing I've seen in awhile. I forgot how rad this channel is. Well done sir.,1
"Dude, I love how genuine your reactions were! I've had fun watching this, and not only: I was really interested to see what each one of those gadgets did.",1
"Infinity Dodecahedrons are seriously cool. I bought another (smaller) one, and I really enjoy it. It's definitely an eye catcher and a conversation starter!",1
"I personally enjoy the old school phones.  I have such a hard time hearing my iPhone at max volume without the speaker on.  If I worked in an office I would definitely buy one.  People forget how ergonomic those old phones are.  It's not particularly comfortable holding a rectangle to your head.  I also have physically sensitive ears so any type of headphones, ear phones, whatever... cause me a bunch of pain.  Looks like a good product that can both be a gag and something for people out there like me who have a tough time using a regular mobile phone.",1
The fact he didn't buy the Nicholas Cage spoon is outrageous.,0
I have to say it after watching this video it feels like the journey you're on this year has been effective. It simply feels like you're enjoying life and its what I enjoy most about watching your videos. You manage to pass that joy on. Just the musings of a random stranger. 😀,1

as somebody with a comp sci degree and a decent amount of irl experience i will say edge computing is problematic at its core because client side workload like this is a huge security breach.  this is why even online video games avoid client side scripting.  it is a huge vector for exploit.  it is always interesting to watch a video like this because you are blown away when you listen regarding these other technologies you may not know allot about but when they cover a technology you know about you realize you must question the quality of the info in the other cases where you cannot determine the quality yourself,0
"The fire suppression without water was incredible. It could save many lives and property especially if it could be auto activated like a heat detector. Imagine how much property and how many sleeping people could be saved, especially if this had a built in alarm and was rigged to keep hallways clear of fire. What an invention....WOW.",1
"I'd really appreciate a study into the potential advantages of META Materials in manipulating light, EMF, heat and even replacing silicon as semiconductors. Nearly every industry can benefit from the improvements and cost reductions, META Materials can provide. Really enjoy your videos, thank you!",1
I was totally shocked that Fusion power generation wasn't included - possibly as big a leap as quantum computing in its impact on humanity.,0
"I love the one about the hydrogen fuel cells....Considering this technology has been around for about 20 years...Just hasn't been used, due to a lack of pressure on the industry, and the fact that the patent was buried by large corporate interests.",1
"I wish that when people talked about types of skin damage, they'd acknowledge what that looks like for people with darker skin. we don't get red rashes after sunburn. even my darkest bruises are often difficult to spot because of hyper-pigmentation. the stages of healing for cuts looks vastly different because we don't see the same change in colors around the wound sight. not to mention when you look for images to identify clinical signs, 99% of those images are of lighter skin and only marginally helpful to us looking to identify potentially serious medical issues.",0

My son had botox injections in his legs for years to relax his muscles enough so he could wear splits. He has cerebral palsy. It's crazy knowing that this life changing treatment is also the most dangerous poison.,0
"My mom would've gone nuts for you while I was growing up lol. Her big ""parent fear"" was toxic chemicals and me getting poisoned so she was always lecturing me about stuff under the sink and making sure I didn't touch the pesticides for the farm. Once she figured out she could call PBS and they'd send her Mr. Yuck stickers the house and barn were *covered* in them",0
"I love how she says that it is poison in the right dose, instead of the wrong dose.",1
My husband got sun poisoning last year. All the symptoms you described. It was not fun. He said his sick were he got burned felt tight for a few months after. Luckily he is a nurse and he was able to give me advice on how to help him in his recovery.,0

Switching from follow mode to whiteboard mode to top-down mode for demos etc. is a purely magical experience.",1
"I honestly have to say, while its still insanely expensive, 3500 for that monitor isn't as bad as I was expecting. And its almost 'reasonable'. Like, its still more than I would ever spend on a single display, and I'm far more into having separate displays but, given what its capable of, the specs, the tech behind it etc. its not that bad. I can see a few people getting real use out of something like that,.",1
Imagine losing the cursor on that screen and trying to find it 💀,0

"The sound test killed me, that was hilarious. And the wrist rest is brilliant, I often get marks on my wrist from my mousepad.",1
"What a tough selection this month! Whether it be the soundbar, the lamp speaker or even the pc panel display they all seem something that would really improve my set up, but for me it may have to be the soundbar one,  looks smart, has nice RGB and a decent size and price. Very good month of tech this month!",1
I absolutely love this series!  All of the items were neat but the only one I would actually benefit from would be the chair wheels.  I have a regular office chair that has to roll on carpet and it is kind of a pain.,1
That sensor panel is definitely convenient. Been wanting to make my own with a raspberry pi but just find myself getting off track. Super cool to just be able to purchase and go!,1
"The RGB sound bar would be perfect for my setup! I’ve been using the speakers in my monitor as my main sound system, so it would be a nice upgrade for me.",1
I always love franks energy i also look forward to the end of every month thinking about this series i love the tiltednation sound-bar and i need that for my set up😀😀.,1
"always great to see this series, so many cool things this month, my office setup could use those chair wheels.",1
This series has helped me and my friends find some helpful tech that has helped our setups! The pc panel is gonna be a huge upgrade,1
We need the under $100 for August as well!! This is the best series out there✌️🔥,1
"One really important point: those ionizers can produce potentially dangerous levels of ozone due to the negative ions they create in the air. I'd be cautious of all air ionizers, unless they are advertised specifically as bipolar ionizers. The one that you recommended DOES produce ozone, which can be very harmful",0
"Been a good while since I've been a student but I still watched the vid to find out what cool gadgets are out there. Didn't think I'd be walking away from it with a productivity tip, that idea of the simple timer is so good, instead of devices that can also do time. Great vid ,Frank.",1
The desktop lamp is definitely my favorite. It’s also something I’ve been looking for because I updated to a keyboard that doesn’t have shine through keycaps so it’s definitely a need too.,1

"Fantastic video Frank. You always bring really cool stuff to the front that most of us haven't seen/heard anything about. Hope you and the fam are doing well XD
Btw, that kb for only $100? I know they've gotten a lot cheaper but hot damn. I don't NEED it but I want it lol. My biggest complaint with 60% kb's is the lack of arrow keys and this has those and looks super sleek with those colors. Love it. Take care man!",1

"In my experience, burnout comes from realizing that improved performance doesn't produce improved rewards, it produces more work. The response to a job well done is never a couple days off or a timely bonus, instead good work is ""rewarded"" with the demand for twice as much work in the same amount of time. Firms see young workers as a productivity sponge to be squeezed for all it's worth, young people are almost never treated as the company's future.",0
"I am 50 years old working in the high tech industry, mentally tired and sick of the weekly 8 to 5 routine. Never got a proper day off even through the pandemic.  Hats off to the millenials and GenZ that think differently and put more weight on LIVING rather than just WORKING.",0

"As someone who used to work 80 hours a week, quitting my job to become a freelancer was the best thing I have ever done. Sure I still work a lot of hours and often close to 70-80 hrs a week, I feel like I am doing this for myself and not some corporation.",1
"I have a high paying tech job that I’m about to leave. I feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it, even though I worked hard to get to where I am. I was promoted very fast after 5 years. I know it’s something many people would love to have and honestly I’m happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot. Ultimately I became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life. I have lived humbly, saved every thing I could, paid off debts as quickly as possible, and have enough to live for 8 months to a year. I’m hoping to come back into the industry as a healthier employee or have found something else fulfilling.

For anyone wishing they had one of these jobs or feel frustrated by people that appear to be complaining, I hope you achieve your dream and get one. You can do it, keep at it! Taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing. I am taking a break because my mental health and stress hospitalized me (don’t let that scare you, I just have my own personal stuff too 😄).",1
"I’m a Software developer. I understand the struggle but us tech workers should count our lucky stars. We are very privileged to be where we are. Most jobs outside of tech have less perks, much lower pay, and more stress. I am grateful everyday to be in this field. Once I accumulate enough wealth to purchase my freedom, I’ll see myself out.. maybe. In the meantime, I will run the race as long as I have to.",1
"The thing is, if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule, you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility. You must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time, and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially. Leadership needs to model that behavior by taking time off and making sure everyone knows they're taking time off. This also empowers your teams, letting them know that you trust them to work without constantly staring over their shoulders.",1
"""Compare that to ... physicians, only 42% said they were burned out"" - Yes, indeed, a perfectly acceptable percentage.",1
"I worked a low paying tech job for six years and still felt the burn out. The problem is that tech is very fast paced and competition focused. You can barely keep up. Though I got promoted regularly, my higher ups told me the truth before they left, they said that I was severely underpaid based on my skills (essentially I branded myself a one stop shop for the marketing department as I am both technically knowledgeable, people oriented and strategic). I maxed out at $50K. So I decided to jump ship with little planned. Now I run a financial agency with my husband and we make $250K a year as entrepreneurs and we have the freedom to set our own lifestyle.",0

"That motion alarm for protecting your laptop makes me laugh.  If you are taking a break away from your workplace do you really think that the alarm feature would deter a thief from simply knocking the device to the floor, pick up the laptop and (perhaps) step on the alarm and crush it in a moment of disdain.  By the time you get back with your latte after your phone notifies you of your impending bad luck your laptop will be off on an extended trip.",0
That cable organiser would be incredible in my dorm room,1
The Trene Control Alarm will not deter someone who really wants it.  They will just knock that gadget off and run with your property.,0

"I spent hours researching dash cams a  year or so ago and it’s almost maddening how awful, sparse and misrepresented information on dash cams is. I was totally surprised how under developed they are. This is a video that is really necessary.",0
Vids like these are definitely a service for looking out for everyone to avoid buying crap and hype in dashcams. Well done in the research! Thanks LTT!,1
"I did not expect to love this video as much as I did... it epitomizes the very best of YouTube in my opinion - a well-made video with a well-constructed narrative, hosted flawlessly and provides a genuinely good service to everyone, even if they are not in the market for these products. Love your work LTT Team!",1
Thank you Linus for spending the big bucks and testing all these cameras for our benefit. I will be keeping your recommendations in mind when I purchase my camera.,1
"THIS is the kind of content that we need. Calling out trash markets and helping people find honest answers, doing the side-by-side comparisons they can't do. Thanks for this! Glad to know the Rove R2-4K I got as a gift is not far from really the peak in the market and is ""good enough"" if not overpriced a bit.",1
"Yup, it's amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country. In germany we have an entirely different line of knock-off chinese brands. Which ultimately look alike same goes for the Australian / american market. I am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within South Korea, Japan if anybody could give a hint to that! I mean surely they must have great dashcams right? Japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts, and well South Korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind.

I bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine. Problem I have with it is quality related the G-Sensor broke not long after I bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate. This creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings. And in that mode you can't disable the screen from flashing so at night drives you'll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope. It's your f#+*^# dashcam You can improve further the video quality for e.g. when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ND-Filter you just have to find your own way to mount them. Usually there is full filter clamping solutions. Because you'll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow.

I didn't do this yet as I did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so

"In all fairness, the VIOFO actually looks pretty great. Actually worth considering over the Thinkware F70 if the budget isn't too tight.",1
"When I went looking for a dashcam my main criteria was that it has a super cap instead of a battery, cause I really don't think the batteries would handle the -20 to -30c temps in winter and the exact opposite in the summer along with however much the sun heats up the interior. (I know you can take them off but I kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system)

For actual performance it's much better to just find someone elses footage cause the resolution and other specs are very misleading, unless you really know your camera sensor specs.",0
"I had my suspicions about this for a long time, thank you for finally calling this issue out.  It sounds like there's a hole in the market for a truly high quality dashcam that's not Chinese crap.  Hopefully some tech company sees this and swoops in.  I'm tired of all these countless trash brands on Amazon with unpronounceable names.",0

I love the fact that you put “Thinnest Rick Roll” and “Can you legally employ a cat” on the search history even if it flashed on the screen for a second. You are one of the only creators that put 100% effort and detail into their content. Keep it up!,1
"I’d say the coolest thing in this video is the desk pc. Saves room and it’s cool to see the desk, but I wonder how much it cost and if it’s worth buying?",1

"In spite of the huge upgrades, especially for the Pro models, it would be interesting to see how many will upgrade to the iPhone 14 lineup, given that the iPhone 13 lineup is as popular as ever",1
Honestly can’t wait for the camera testing you do on the pros. As a iPhone 8 user anything will be an improvement though lol.,1
"Definitely upgrading from my 12 Pro Max to the 14 Pro Max, I'll get at least half the cost of the new phone back with trade in. Major upgrade in battery, camera, and the screen.",1
In my opinion the 13 mini is the best phone ever made. Seems I’m in a minority but it’s brilliant.,1
"Eh, I’m sticking with my 13 Pro Max until probably the 15 or 16. The cameras on the 14 Pros are literally the biggest worthwhile change this year imo.",1
I'm going to wait for the scheduled iPhone 15 Pro which will be scheduled to release in October 2023 if everything goes to plan. It is expected to have a USB C port and faster charging like the iPhone 14 series. This is what really matters for me.,1
"I might upgrade from my 11 Pro to the 14 Max. I guess I don’t care enough to spend the money on the pro Max, but I want the bigger display and better battery life",1

"This was one of the best ""cool tech"" episodes in a while, wow... That pocket operator was awesome and I don't even make music",1
I used to have that audio interface. 10/10 for those who wanna switch from a usb mic to xlr. Great choice of items this month Frank 👌,1
Love those pocket operators. Never heard of them until this video and now I've done a ton of research on em lol. Would like to pick one up someday. Thanks for bringing this dope tech to our attention good sir!,1
That LED Message Board is super cool! So many options for use. Love watching your videos and seeing all of the cool affordable tech!,1
Love the Wormier keyboard! I have a full size keyboard and the compact option looks amazing and will be a better fit for my small desk.,1
I love how there's infinite possibilities that you can do with the pocket operator. Would love to pick up one of those for exploring it!,1
My favorite cool tech gadget in this episode was definitely the audio interface as I am starting to get into the streaming world. Great episode and for the amazing content.,1
"Gotta say this is one of the best episodes of the series in a while! I actually think every single one of these things would be something I'd go out to buy, especially the LED sign.

"This was a fascinating look at something I love, by some genuinely interested people. I will add that you can build a significantly cheaper race bike, for a lower key series and still have fun on the track. I have a Minitwin which is relatively cheap to run, but a friend of mine has a litre plus missile and every time he crashes it, it costs about £5k and six months at least to fix! However, I far prefer long adventure rides to whizzing around the track, all of which you can do on a minitwin. 😁",1
"As a lapsed Superbike obsessive. It always bothered me hearing GCN call top road bikes Superbikes.
Now I mostly watch cycling and I'm used to it.",0
"Hanging onto my 8T for now. Curious to see what OnePlus does after the 10 overall coz the 9 & 10 didn't move me. They keep constantly moving from what made them great with each variant 😩, the OnePlus 6 being their last great phone",1
I’m waiting for the Oneplus 10S or P or Q,1
Pretty happy with the oneplus 9. Camera is killer for sunny days on the beach. The oneplus carbon fiber case makes it feel excellent in the hand.,1
OnePlus have been making some solid looking hardware these days. That being said it does feel like they have been sort of trying to become the next Samsung with the number of phones that they have been launching.,1

Lots of profit negative tech startup companies with an over abundant of overpaid employees…..honestly who hasn’t seen this coming?,0
"What slowdown lol? It was abnormally fast and now with the recession, VCs realized many of these startups aren’t profitable so they laid off people. The big ones are still hiring and tech adoption isn’t nearly as much for it to slow down anytime soon.",0
Slow hirings may be caused by a rapid rising labor cost in hi tech ind,0
"That's really a problem with service economy. Most tech companies don't even produce a nail. They do things that are intangible, you cay easily live without them. If Netflix goes down I am sure there will not be any catastrophic event. If some manufacturing companies goes down, let's say the one that makes baby formula, it could trigger a panic.",0
Good video as usual 👌👌,1

The future of Tech is soo beautiful,1
"Good day, Future Tech. I noticed your excellent video and am impressed with your amazing sharing on products. We'd love to collab on a new product experience we're working on, what would be the best email to contact you?",1
"Could Coolper become the average New Yorker’s dream? Hmm, make that every ‘coffee lover’..... can’t help but notice Pixy’s here again. A nice hands free it is.👍",1
Enjoyed your video and I gave it a Thumbs Up for the support of your channel,1
"2:09 so I'm guessing when you make an ad for your product do you really want a guy sleeping right in the middle with an ""It is what it is"" pillow? >.< lol while everyone else is having fun
2:37 and that blistering scooter speed of 0-30 meters.... per hour >.< I think you meant kilometers per hour. 
All in all pretty cool stuff. I like the Coolper I can really see that taking off. Huupe seems to be novelty. I can imagine the horror as soon as someone forgets there is a TV there and slams a ball only to shatter the device lol. The life straw actually works. Ive seen several science channels take pond water and view it under a microscope then filter it and view it again. It really does work but it does not filter out chemicals in the water, just microparticles and microbes.",1

"For all people after Covid who want their smell back : I did exactly what she described BUT went a step further and tried to smell back first SMELLS I USED TO HATE or made me want to puke. I feel that it trully helped getting my smell back faster !!! The hate in our brain is a true booster, it just triggers something XD 
Please let me know if it worked for you too! Wishing all a speed recovery <3",1
"It still blows my mind that companies have entire teams deciding whether or not a flavor is going to appeal to the masses, and yet somehow Swedish Fish flavored Oreos were still greenlit.",0
"That “section of the tongue” theory is so funny to me because it’s what I was taught as a fact in my high school anatomy class and I was trying to test that out on my own and never could, I would always taste every flavor no matter where it was in my mouth. I have never heard anyone say it wasn’t true so it’s cool to hear now",1
This woman is unbelievably amazing - I want a PhD in taste and I want her to be my professor - I’m a lawyer and after this ONE video I’m prepared to quit and pursue taste 😂,1
"What she said about the packaging affecting the taste is so true! I always think delivery pizza smells so good, and it’s the pizza in the cardboard box that makes it smell amazing. Just not the same without the box 😆",1
"when I was a kid in kindergarten we did an experiment with that old fake 'five flavors' taste zones thing and I never got it. I could always taste everything on every part of my tongue.
I felt vindicated like two decades later when it came out that that was horsecrap but I can't exactly go rub it in my kindergarten teacher's face can I",0

"Also, the amount of carbonation to syrup isn't set in the soda machines, and can be changed.  A soda with more carbonation is a 'dry' soda. A restaurant I loved would mix their own rootbeer syrup, and you could ask for it to be a dry or sweet, whichever was your preference.",1
Maybe it's because I know she's an audiologist but she annunciates everything beautifully and speaks with an even sound level. Like she clearly works with the hearing impared to naturally say every sound in a word to be heard as easily as possible,1
"I’m so glad she talked about how hearing aids are more complicated than just a mic and speaker, as someone who has had two of them since I’ve been four I’ve had to explain that so many times (also having automatic Bluetooth ears is super cool)",1
"My doctor also told me that our ears are self-cleaning. But when I pressured her for some off-the-record advice, she finally conceded that if I really.. REALLY.. felt the need to clean inside my ear canal, I could go ahead and use my elbows. I just adore my doctor!",1
"Brilliant, well-spoken, well-enunciated, and a welcoming and animated face.  Great video!  I learned a lot.",1
"The way I was hyped to to this!! I was born with hearing loss, so I had to see MANY audiologist in my life so far. People like her made my life so much easier. Her talking about hearing aids and clearing up misconceptions or even spreading knowledge made me smile ear to ear.",1
About earplugs at concerts - there are a variety of frequency-balanced earplugs that protect your hearing while preserving the sound quality of the music (Eargasm and Hearos are a couple of examples). I HIGHLY recommend them!,1
"Honestly, my main take away is that I've been saying ""tinnitus"" wrong my whole life.",0
"Loved this as someone who previously studied to be an audiologist in the past. Also just love all of the ""expert answers"" videos on this channel. Thanks WIRED and Dr. Emily!",1
"This was super fascinating, although the part about the ear drum being able to self repair was the most surprising to me.",1
The universal hate for printers is what unites humanity.,0
I suddenly gained immense amount of respect for Dyson after watching this.,1
I'm just shocked and saddened that they've ignored the most significant vacuum cleaner advance: the retractable cord.,0
You know you’ve made it in life when you can wear glasses like that with absolute conviction.,1
James Dyson is actually giving really good advice here. A lot of these types of Q&A's give really generic advice.,1
Probably the best interview/Answers so far. He leaps off the screen with his eloquent and articulate manner. It is very apparent that he is simply a genius.,1
"This was so entertaining, I had no idea the person behind Dyson was a true, genuine and passionate inventor. And to see him speak so nicely about independent designers and the unfair problems they face was amazing!",1
"James Dyson: Makes legendary household appliances like vacums and hair dryers
Also James Dyson: Loves his cast aluminum pencil sharper.

"On the wireless phone charger, I could see installing it under the wood in your nightstands if you have the right kind of furniture for the job. Also, the Echo Dot stand is super cute! Definitely made me think of Portal Turrets too!  Definitely my favorite!",1
"Loved the “invisible” charger, would definitely contribute to keeping my clean.",1
"Wow, that wireless desk charger is insanely cool. I would love one of those.",1
This channel is actually really cool. Instead of being just a kickstarter compilation these are all actual product reviews. Going to watch a few more before subscribing but so far extremely good channel,1
This might be the best episode of this series ever. So many great ideas!,1
The charger was my favorite. The hidden feature is cool but what I really like is the easy under the desk installation that also saves space,1
"What an awesome video, I love to see new affordable products come out!  This makes me wonder why certain tech devices have such an immense shelf price.  If more technology can be produced at cheaper costs, there may be some advancement in the asking price from many everyday-used devices such as laptops or desktops",1
I love wireless setups and the wireless charger is always a bonus! Thanks for the best content as always!,1
"Oh imagine when they get those sound wave extinguishers in giant sizes to catch the forest fires real quick. The people, animals and homes saved would be amazing. Not to mention the forests as well. What a brilliant invention. 😁👍☘️",1
"Imagine we could just buy a sized sheet of film like a screen protector then place it on any window or surface we like , such as a mirror , bench top or car windscreen , and then be able to utilise it like a touch screen 👍 would be more practical than buying an expensive mirror",1
"It’s awesome, but what happens to the humans that used to do these jobs?",1
"I can confirm her squirrel facts.  I raised an orphaned one, and it was the sweetest cuddliest pet until it almost grown.  Woke up one morning an she acted like a wild animal: biting, scratching, trying to eat my face off...  It was a sad day, but I've checked wanting a squirrel off my list!",0
Adore the collection of people you have answering questions. They are so intelligent in their respective subject and superbly passionate. Love learning more.,1
"I swear to God, every ""can I have this exotic pet"" question can just be answered with the words ""Do you know what 'domestication' is and how long it takes?""",0
"Declawing cats.
Stop calling it declawing, it has nothing to do with the claws.
As the vet said, it is amputating the toes.
Cats have claws. If you have a problem with claws, dont get a cat.",0
"THANK YOU for addressing declawing cats, and how awful and hurtful it is to the cat!",0
I have a cat who was declawed by a previous owner. He has so many behavioral issues that are typical of declawed cats. He was just at the vet yesterday for litter box issues and the vet brought up the fact that he was declawed. Declawing inflicts lifelong trauma on the animal.,0
This woman was born to be a vet. You can just tell. She's the 1% of Kindergarten girls who's living the dream! 😎👍🏻🙏🏻,1
"Exotic animals as pets should be illegal. Tigers don't belong in farms, sugar gliders don't belong in apartments. Sad to see that this happens still.",0
"If you decide to brush a cat's teeth, a fencing mask is highly recommended.",1
"I had a recent fall at work and because I trained myself how to fall off a bike safely, I only had minor bruising on my butt. I did a tuck and roll like when I fall off the bike. Great advise Alex and Ollie.",1
"When I got right hooked a few years ago, I only had time to think “this is gonna suck” and then proceeded to roll a ways on the pavement. Fortunately, I came away with ‘only’ bruises and road rash. Nothing got broken, and I think in part it was because I didn’t have a chance to put my hands out. Also, glad I was wearing a helmet!",1
"#AskGCNTech after two years of running tubes, I finally went tubeless a couple of months ago. I managed to puncture my tyre the other day. Sealant didn’t do the trick nor did a couple of slugs - even tried a patch inside the tyre. The puncture was not on the sidewall and may have been 3mm large. Given the tire had plenty of life left, I am gutted that I may have to discard the tire now. When would you come to a decision that a tubeless tire is KO?",0
"My last crash (3 yrs ago).  I was on the ground so fast, I had no time to react or prepare for the impact.  But the scar from my collar bone repair looks pretty cool...",1
"Another problem with filling tires with water is that the first bump you hit will probably cause the tire to blow off the rim.  Water is incompressible, unlike air, so it has to go somewhere when the tire volume gets changed due to an impact.",0
"#AskGCNTech As a heavier rider, I feel I’m always in the max range of gears, either hardest gear on flat’sh roads or my easiest gear when I see any sustained gradients. I currently run a compact chain set with a 12-30 cassette on the rear. Would I benefit from upping my chain set to give me more usable gears or would this just make my climbing problem even worse due to the worse range at the rear",0
"I bought an old tractor to help clear the land I was building on. ""Stick with me."" 
I was towing a large log when I felt the back of my leg getting wet. No problem on the front of my trousers thank goodness. Turned out that a large sick had punctured one of the rear tires (tyres) 
Apparently it was fairly common practice to half fill the rear tyres (tires) with water to improve traction due to the added weight. Maybe sealant would be a better idea. Expensive though.
Love the show guys",1
"Having shot Canon for 20 years I switched the Nikon in 2016. Love both brands, but prefered the Nikon ergonomics with the dual command dials rather than the Canon methodology of the 4 buttons on the top plate. R5 really improved that but I love the ISOless nature of the Nikon sensors. Canon is getting better in that regard but still behind Nikon and Sony.",1
"Hey Marques! I know these sound insignificant, but since you rarely update your little dongles/accessories that you carry around and your apps on your home screens, I think it would be interesting to get a little maybe quarterly series where you talk about any changes and what you'd like to see changed/simplified with those work flows. Just an idea!",1
"@MKBHD I""m a photographer and use the Peak EDC V2.  I'm impressed you got a 16"" into the 20L  I'm sure it's a snug fit and doesn't leave alot of room for a ipad too.  Wanted to give you a little tip I found on that bag, here goes: The main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones, airpods, etc go.  You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they're in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.  Not only that when they're done charging the battery starts charging.  I wake up with everything ready to go.  Hope you enjoy trying this out. :)",1
Would love to see an EDC/daily tech for everyone else in The Studio!,1
Marques's reaction was genuine here. He was excited to know as what will come out of his bag next 🤪,1
"I went to check out the Opal camera because I need a webcam upgrade and it looked pretty legit. I loved everything I saw on the site up until the point of the $4/month fee to use their software?! on a $300 webcam?! I think I'll just get a capture card for my mirrorless or pick up a Logi webcam instead :/

other than that, nice tech kit.

Also, yeah, your experience with the Pixel 6 mirrors my past experience with Pixel phones. I got one to try something different to the iPhone and I loved it for a few months. I tried a few customizations but found that leaving it stock was generally the best experience for me. Then it started unexpectedly slowing down or apps would wig out and crash on me out of nowhere or the camera just wouldn't or it would reboot in the middle of doing something.",1
"You are carrying great tech, and it makes total sense that you are rellying more and more on Apple, their ecosystem is really good. I am an Android user and don't stick to just one brand but my wife is All-Apple and she really likes how seemless everything is. Cool stuff Marques.",1
"Hey Marques, can you do an updated “The Ecosystem explained” I think a lot of viewers would appreciate a video not only for Apple side of the ecosystem but also Android, seeing as though a lot of new products are coming out in support for easy use for Androids. Love all your videos btw! 🖤",1
I can see that exoskeleton helping people with limited mobility in the future. It's a marvelous piece of tech. Thanks for giving us a glimpse of things to come!,1
"the exoskeleton probably wouldn’t be affordable for everyone to use, and may have long term effects, but i think it would be amazing for rehabilitation and other medical related use!",1
"I've got that Azeron keypad. HIGHLY recommend it for all kinds of applications where quickness is ideal, but especially for gaming. Highly highly. You can even find certain models on Amazon usually. I ordered mine from the factory, for the color scheme and one of the newer designs. (the one on this video is the original design, which I'm sure is still just as phenomenal, but my fingers twitch randomly sometimes, so having the buttons above the knuckle could have been a problem.",1
The game pad that you highlighted actually is already available. I am a right arm amputee and also a big gamer and was considering buying it but it’s over $200 US and you would still need a mouse. Also I have already become very proficient using a standard controller for gaming already and mostly mostly use an Xbox controller for my PC so I decided it wasn’t worth it.

"Just a note on the screw driver. Put some ""extended"" bits with it or a smaller precision screw driver in the set with it.  Its very common for some screws to be deep in a hole and having those small bits into hex end wont go in far enough down the hole to extract screw. I see this allot on Laptops, controllers that kinda thing. Sunk in screws suck.",0

"So many great products on this list! These are all incredibly practical too, especially the macropad. The abililty to customize literally every aspect of it is killer.",1
"The Hoto laser was a pretty good change of pace, loved it. Feels very complementary to the theme of office gadgets! Keep em coming! Ideas: specific under-desk drawers, and other more “furniture” alike stuff that will make your setup noice.",1
Just discovered your channel and the series. Going to be watching your older ones today while working. That macro pad is really cool. That would definitely be something I'd pick up and use.,1
That macropad looks killer! Been looking for a segue into custom keyboards for a while and that seems like a great place to start. Looks like it would be incredibly useful for both work and personal applications too which is a huge plus. Would love to have one in the near future!,1

This is a common misconception. While part of the reason was the battery being too thin, the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch, which was a tiny dent in the top (left?) corner. This would cause the battery to eventually short out, as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other. Most people's phones were exploding while fast charging, which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery, and lithium-ion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that.

Edit: Normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine, and would never cause issues, but they made the battery too thin, meaning it shorted it out easier. Just wanted to clarify that.",0

If they take govt funds, then they should be subject to immediate regulation.",0
"The states deregulated tuition and fees so the colleges could charge more. Then, they used that money to hire more administrators and build more buildings. The students are not just paying for their education. They are also paying for all the things the colleges wanted, but the states did not want to give them money for. Nobody talks about that.",0

Shows what a tremendous difference we can make by being alert and notifying the authorities when suspicious. Better to be safe than sorry. The police aren’t able to do this on their own without us all being aware and responsible citizens. Massive thank you to all those involved especially those who did chose to speak up! 🙏🏻🕊,1
I’m grateful that someone was paying attention and called it in and everyone is safe. I’m sad for the young lady though who feels like it was the only place she could go to feel accepted. I hope she can find some peace and friendship in a more permanent way.,1
My friends were there last night. FUCKING PROPS to those that called it in!,0
Excellent job to the Grant county sheriff's office and to the people attending the concert who kept an eye out and reported it.,1
This is terrifying. A couple days ago I was just talking to my friend who went to a music festival where the security didn't even check bags. She was kinda scared how an event like that could easily be the target of mass shooting.,0
So sorry about Mr. Engle's son. condolences to the family.,0
"Dear Richard Engel and his wife, my sincere condolences on your loss. Your pain cannot be imagined but your bravery and courage in sharing your son's struggles is felt and now his legacy may hold a cure down the road for other families so they will never have to endure your heartbreak. Sending you blessings and hugs. Please stay safe and strong.❤️🙏",1
I'll be so glad when the whole tRump Drama is over. 5 years of a bad play is too much for any audience member to endure.,0
Two of the most important jobs are sadly also the most underappreciated... teachers and nurses deserve so much more. More money. More respect. More support.,1

Netflix in a lot of trouble now especially as more market competition comes in from other distributors. This move into gaming will not do them any favours.,0
"The reason Netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content, their own content, when it's good, is constantly neglected, and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it. Getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what they're doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults. People are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update. People are used to getting the next season of a series once every year, but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release, even before COVID.",0
"When I first got into watching Netflix, there were a lot of low budget but very original and interesting documentaries and TV series on it. However in recent times, I feel like a lot of the diversity in the platform has gone.",1
"This is the problem with these big companies, their core offering starts to fail and they think moving focus elsewhere is the answer instead of making sure their core offering is decent.",0
I worked in retail for most of my life and the one thing I have never forgotten is the fact that once you lose a customer you are going to play hell trying to get them back regardless of what you do.,0
"I think it’s so silly that Netflix feels the need to compete with YouTube and TikTok. I think these platforms should be able to exist together in harmony as they each offer very different products. Eg. People can follow along with reactions/reviews and video essays while watching a Netflix series.

People also don’t typically like when YouTubers are given a large budget like with YouTube Red originals, so Netflix buying out certain YouTubers is not the right idea…",0
"Honestly maybe it would have made more sense to commission more games based on their original IPs. Yeah it takes longer to come out, but you’ll get better quality and hopefully better return on investment",1
"I think this is gonna take Netflix back to its feets, it just needs more perseverance. And the ability to be positive minded",1
Linus!!! Just turn the key lights  180 and bounce them off the walls. You’ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting. It’s such a simple fix. I’m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face 😅,1

I'm surprised getting all the collectibles didn't even get an honorable mention. There's been more than enough people who couldn't 100% the Arkham games simply because they didn't like the Riddler trophy collecting quest (especially Arkham Knight due to how many times you had to use the batmobile JUST for those collectibles).,0
The one that annoyed me was the Borderlands 1 when to obtain you had to play online with someone from Gearbox or with someone who already had the trophy. They changed it for the rerelease to playing with three players at once.,0
"I always adored FFVIII. My older brother gifted me with the strategy guide when I first bought it, so that may have something to do with it lol. That said, if you're trying to 100% FFVIII on the og north american release, good luck. A strategy guide will not help you get the ribbon",1
"The original infamous hurt my soul. I played through the campaign twice on hard to get the platinum only to find out while I was doing cleanup that the stunt master trophy can't be completed post game. I had all but one stunt, to knock 3 enemies off a roof at once. When you clear out an area enemies no longer spawn in large numbers, therefore there isn't enough enemies to get the stunt. I didn't have it in me to start another campaign. The sad part is I had tried the stunt on multiple occasions only for it to glitch and not award the stunt.",0
"AC3 was super annoying when first released because of having to pass the mission the first time without any retry. 

Problem was, the controls were clunky af and the goals of the missions most of the time were annoying or without too much logic like ""do not touch water"".",0
"Multiplayer trophies tied to the platinum will always, ALWAYS be the worst.",0
"So glad you did multiplayer awards lumped with single player awards. That is the biggest bullshit for single game players that don't want to listen to children screaming, neck beards eating or just racist hateful crap, just for a trophy.",0
I honestly feel like COD MW on did it best on Xbox 360. Achievements for single player and challenges for multiplayer. That was 2007. Now I’m 34 with a wife and kids. It’s almost unimaginable trying to do 100% a game with multiplayer supporting a family and working.,1

"I adopted a mindset of delaying my gaming brain by a year. If a game comes out in 2022, I wait until 2023. I get it at its cheapest and usually complete. I have been doing this with every game I buy for the last 5 years and I have saved so much money while enjoying the games much more.",1
"I used to pre-order games to get the “collectible” toy that was sought after. The items got really cheap really fast. Not worth it. They also tell you that there may not be enough copies, that never happened! There was always enough copies!",0
"Good video. These are the kinds of topics and discussions the gaming industry needs to need to be having now. Publishers, developers, the media, and gamers themselves. 

Have to throw one in though. For every game with a yearly release, I also have to point out games with decade or more release cycle. How long between GTA 5 and 6? Fallout 4 and 5? Skyrim and Elder Scrolls 6?",1
"I wish developers would realize that forced DRM and Internet connectivity for games is a step backward. Look at the debacles GT7 and SimCity have endured; what's the point of paying a full $70 for the game if there is no guarantee you can play it at your leisure, especially if this ridiculous requirement is in place for SINGLE-PLAYER modes?

In my opinion, at that point, you can't help but wonder if spending time with the game is either fun or just another full time job. This is not why people play games.",0
"When I think about the games I played the last few years, I must say, that I almost always enjoyed indie titles alot more than big IPs. So I rather pay 30€ for an indie title, that is really inspiring with fresh new ideas than wasting 60€+ on a broken AAA title without any innovations.",1
"I havent bought a game on release for the past 6 years now. The gaming industry has changed for a while now, and its only getting worse. I buy 3~4 games per year at most and usually heavily discounted. Quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowadays, CoD and Battlefield lost their way. Quality single player games are still a thing but are often filled with bugs on release so i wait it out and buy GoTY editions usually and often second hand (gotta love disc edition systems). I refuse to fuel bad descions made by money hungry devs or publishers.",0
"I tend to stick to games made before 2010 as they give the best value and experience.
Feels like games were made for fun rather then rip off the player.",1
"This video made me a bit sad. Made me realise how the industry has changed, and not for the better. I have young children so can’t game like I used to but when I do have time I find myself increasingly drawn back to older games that I’ve played before but adore, the vast majority of new games just don’t appeal to me. As for the new gen consoles…what’s the point, all they seem to be doing is rereleasing older gen games. Yawn",0

"I've been around for every console generation.  I remember thinking during the Genesis/Turbografx era (SNES not out quite yet) what games would be like when I was old, and the kind of specs they would need.  Obviously I had no idea what the specs really meant back then, but I was thinking ""256-bit"" lol.  (as for the CPU, and 64-bit is all we really need for that)  They have happily progressed faster than I had imagined, looking just as good today, if not better, then I imagined things would look like 20~25 years from now.  The 1990's and early 2000's with the massive clock speed increases and the advent of the GPU were the main things that took us to where we are, hardware wise.",1
"We are an architecture and construction company in Chile, and we have used Unreal Engine for a long time and it is the best for real-time visualization 😁 The preview versions of Unreal 5 were already spectacular and the best thing is the lighting - Lumion really changed everything.
It's great that this is being talked about not only in games but also in movies and other experiences like ours... There are plenty of tutorials to learn ❤ we did it that way.

  Out of fear... to learn it!",1
I actually home every game system dating back to my Atari 2600. I never ever thought games would look this good. I can't imagine how they will look 20 years from now with how fast technology keeps moving forward.,1
I'm over the moon hyped for The Day Before. I hope it delivers in the hype like Elden Ring did. If that's even possible for developers other than FromSoft.,1
Most games these days look mind blowing especially when you can remember when gaming pretty much first started with games like pong etc.,1
I think we’ve reached the point that these devs need to come up with better idea and aí. For decades now they just been able to make games look better. A lot of games are actually worse gameplay wise with stale ideas and dumbed down mechanics than older games.,0
These games look insane can't wait to play some of them great list by the way,1
"I'm so glad I built a nice high end RTX 3090 pc a year ago. It's incredible the amount of eye candy 4K gaming treats us with, no wonder it's the biggest money making entertainment industry on the planet. Thanks for those awesome little previews & nicely presented too, much appreciated👌",1

"Wow I'm impressed, think they've set a new bar with that spec and it being a 42""",1
This monitor looks really clean with almost no bezels. I like how it’s got a tilt adjustable stand as well. Nice video,1
My favorite part of this tv (42'' is basically tv size) is the custom heatsink. I don't care too much about the size of the back of the monitor as long as it doesn't dim the brightness constantly.,1
Great video! I think I'll still be leaning toward the C2 though as the £400 price difference at the moment is too appealing.,1
"Awesome review! What are your thoughts on the picture quality compared to the LG C2 42? Does the matte coating make a noticeable difference to the picture quality? I want to get a new monitor for work and gaming but not sure if i should get the C2 at a cheaper price, this, or perhaps wait another year for something new?",1
"OLED Gaming
Wow, please compare to the C2 you had as a monitor? side by side to see that contrast difference, uniform brightness difference etc for those comparing the C2 42 and this. Love your content",1
"Thanks for the review, i can't wait for your full review!

My dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this:  42 inches or so, anti-glare, normal aspect ratio not ultra wide, but 1440 @ 200mhz instead of 4k (because not even a 3090ti will do anywhere near 4k @ 138mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway).

If possible, i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review:

- What do resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor (try playing a game in 1080/1440 and seeing what the monitor's scaling is like)
- In the settings, what HDR options are available?

Thanks!",1
"Hi @SpawnPoiint, I'm looking forward to the complete review, you're the most thorough and thoughtful reviewer I've seen.

One thing I'd like to see in the review is a comparison with a matte screen, ideally a side-by-side in different conditions to illustrate the pros and cons and help us decide what coating we prefer.
Don't know if that's feasible for you. In any case thanks for the work and enjoy :)",1

Gotta love Lenovo. Got the Ryzen 5600H version of this laptop with the same 3050 after seeing the positive reviews you guys gave it and I couldn't have been happier. It was 700€ in Italy at the time. Paired with my Wacom Cintiq and a RAM upgrade it's been the perfect little gaming and Digital painting set up.,1
"People have been going crazy for the gigabyte G5 KD going for a relativelyaffordable price for an i5 11400H and RTX 3060, would be cool to see you guys buy and review it to see how good it is",1
"Lenovo always been crazy in the budget gaming laptop market. My first introduction to ""PC gaming"" was a 1080p lenovo with SLI 750m's. Was a killer deal too. Back when the 7 series was Nvidia's newest line. I remember looking up so many videos about its performance in games weeks before I got it. I haven't gotten anything Lenovo since as I build my own towers now and get much more premium laptops, but I will always appreciate and respect what Lenovo does.",1
Nice. Definitely a great value.  I still have my old Lenovo 960M 4GB gaming laptop. I never upgraded it from 8gb of ram and that would've been an easy move for more performance. Now it doesn't make sense as I upgraded to an Alienware with a 3080 and 32gb of ram but I still sometimes fire up the Lenovo to see what it can do in 2022.,1
I just bought this today on best buy for 570 dollars! Love to see your making a video on it,1
Recently bought a Lenovo legion laptop for 539 on eBay. 4600h 1650 ti 8gb rams and 512ssd. Never been happier. Lenovo makes the best bang for the buck laptops. Also they aren’t to flashy.,1
"I got an older version of the Ideapad Gaming 3, with a 1650 but with a Ryzen 5600h, and a 512gb ssd. It's an amazing laptop, but I bough it at the time last year for $750, not a bargain but a well balanced laptop for work and gaming",1
"I have the model from 2019. Mine has an i7-9850H and a mobile GTX 1650. This is a great machine aside from some plastic chipping due to the lid being opened and closed.
It annoyingly was $1,300 with discounts.",1
"Oh boy, can't wait to buy it in 2 years when they're in stock!",1
"Never thought I'd say this, but I got my PS5 today. It's absolutely breathtaking.",1
Truly excellent overview; concise and informative.  I genuinely feel better equipped to make my decision regarding the PlayStation 5 after watching your review.  Appreciate you and your consistently fine work.,1
"Just stumbled upon your channel after successfully ordering a PS5 yesterday through Sony Direct. The anticipation of it getting delivered made me want to watch some unboxings and reviews. I came across your channel and immediately clicked because we have the same last name which is neat haha. I actually really enjoyed your video. It’s informative, offers great insight, and very professional while maintaining a personal creative nuance. Thank you!",1
"I got the controller alone for use on my pc and I'm shocked that it works so natively well, of course none game that I know of uses the trigger gimmick... but the sound/vibration feedback works like a charm! sure it does require some set up but it works!",1
"I honestly think Marques should start a gaming channel, only so we can appreciate him ""enjoying"" his tech in the way most people will do. Being very analytical and knowledgeable about tech is a great benefit to those who come to this channel, but there is a slight otherworldliness to seeing some talk about tech in a matter of fact way and not seeing them actually use it in a real world environment and showing that they actually enjoy the thing they are criticising...which to be fair no one with sense would think he doesn't enjoy his tech but seeing it would be a great addition.",1
"The controller really is the coolest thing about the PS5, Astro’s Playroom is insane with the haptics",1
"Can we take a moment appreciate the level of effort Norman put into this video? The research, facts, analysis and narration are top notch. I love the visual aspects like magazines, figures, gone box art and trinkets. Great job Norm!",1
"Being an 80’s baby/ 90’s kid, It just feels like a blessing to have experienced all this first hand.",1
This is hands down the best Nintendo documentary I have seen in my entire life. Huge video game fan. I'm 44 now and getting those memories back is awesome along with tones of things I didn't know. Cheers!,1
"Your documentaries are soooo well written and edited. Thanks for the great content, man!",1
"I’m in my earlier 40s. I’ve found it difficult to go back and still enjoy many of the games from my youth, but Super Mario World still holds up. I think it will continue to stand the test of time with the ageless gameplay and level design. It’s a masterpiece.",1
"A fantastic and well made documentary that truly made me feel like a kid again. I could feel my 5 year old self anticipating this 16 bit treasure as you were describing the build up to Mario world's launch in America. I haven't truly felt that way in a long time. Thank you.

I think I am going to go play some mario world now.",1
First all-nighter I had was with a friend playing Super Mario world. Will never forget it. Seeing the artwork in the instructions book that came along brings back so many memories. Remember how awesome it was when you first discovered the sta rroad?! The top secret area in the Donut ghost house? The music in Vanilla Dome or Valley of Bowser?! Damn it I wanna play now!,1

the fake slide is unfair to the defense... you pursue that and get penalized as a defender,0
"For people complaining on the fake slide, it WAS absolutely legal at the time of the play and was a glaringly awful loophole in the rules. It was changed as a direct result of that play.",0
3:45 seein bill get all excited like that describing the play… just let’s you know how exciting and high IQ Ed reed was in his time. Him and Troy are the best safeties I’ve seen in my lifetime by far,1
"I'm not into sports at all, but, damn I am so amazed at how these guys can act like one mind with a single thought. just incredible cooperation",1
"Polamalu jumping over the line against the Titans is extra smart, because he knows that even if he's too early, it's a flag, but just half the distance to the goal. They're already so close to the goal line that it doesn't matter.",1
"In case you’re wondering why the clock didn’t stop at that obj play, the rule states that if you aren’t gaining yards while going out of bounds, the clock keeps running. This is a great example of OBJ- he can’t just catch, but he can run, throw, kick, you name it.",1
"Wow what an incredibly well researched video, so many great moments and some I haven't even seen before! Only wish you would've included when Alex Smith hid the ball from the refs, but great video nonetheless!",1
The fact chris paul knew that rule is impressive,1
"What a game of football. The passion, the fights, refereeing decisions, all of it. This is why we love the Premier League.",1

I don't see many commenting on the foul that took Havertz down and led to Spurs' first goal. That should have been a card and a free kick. It was clearly a foul in the replay. No wonder Tuchel was so steamed for the rest of the match.,0

I've been out of high school for 7 years in may. It's not very often that I hear a newer song and get sent back to the musical equivalent of me in 2013. I've been trying to do some trauma healing using this song and I think I've made some progress. Slowly but surely I am starting to love myself again after years of just trying to survive wilist hating myself. I may not be happy now but I'm on the road to being there. I don't care if nobody sees this. I just know Im getting better and that's all that matters.,1
Why do I start crying every time this plays. No reason- I just do. I love this song,1

"I played on the field for number 31, i was in the australian juniour league world series team and had alot of memories come back to me from looking at the scenery:)",1
"14:42, this is the most painful one on this list if you ask me. Out of all the premature celebrations out there resulting in losses, this one's just different. The game was over lol. It's not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown. The game is literally over, all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and that's it. The Washington Wizards were up by 3 at that point. Even if the apposing team has time to foul you, you hit just 1 free throw and it's over. Even if you miss both, they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to TIE the game in an impossible amount of time... Long story short, that throw lost them the game after OT lol... Just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards. Gotta be one of the worst throws in sports history.",0
"9:10  The game was almost over and was a blowout at that point, (Dallas 52, Buffalo 17) yet check out Don Beebe still giving 100% effort. After the game Bill's owner Ralph Wilson walked from the owner's booth to the locker room and thanked Beebe for the play.",1
"Being a Packers fan, I remember watching that game against the Seattle Seahawks where Hassleback said they were going to score in OT and when Al Harris picked him off and took it back I remember my family and I was jumping up and down, yelling and going nuts. One of my favorite sports moments ever especially with my favorite team being the ones offering the karma back at Hassleback.",1
"D Hop breaking his ankles, literally, was by far the most savage",0
"""Success is the best revenge"" my dad used to say.. and its true🤗",1
Pujols and Trout taunting with the bow and arrow gestures was priceless.,1
"4:40 isn't even the whole story. The last time Giancarlo Stanton faced Fiers he hit him in the face, ending his season and prompting reconstructive surgery. That's the reason he (and now many baseball players) wear face flaps on their helmets. The very next time they face off, he hits him again. Even if unintentional, that's nuts.",0
This is unreal! Congrats on doing this at such a special place!,1
Dude they actually got Jim Nantz to announce it! Legendary.,1
"I was watching this with my dad, and he didn't believe they were actually at the Masters! It's CRAZY!!! Great job to the editors, the team, and Bryson! Big achievement to be able to play at one of the most prestigious places on Earth!",1
I feel like most people watching this video have 0 idea how unbelievable it is that they were allowed to even be at Augusta before the masters let alone play all sports golf there,0
"It’s always a blessing whenever they decide to play everybody’s favorite battle, another round of All Sports Golf!",1
"THIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO EVER MADE 👏
Well done Dude Perfect, Bryson & the full team",1
"As much as I love seeing these battles, I think the guys should change the frisbees to the disc golfing frisbees, they travel farther than the regular ones!",1
"Awesome video!  Thanks to the Master's management for allowing this.  Great way to keep those youngsters involved.  Very generous from the Masters, as always, all class.",1
"I attended The Masters on Thursday, and the woods on 15 was a great place to stand for a while. So many golfers ended up there and got to see them up close. What a fantastic experience.",1
"This Arsenal side is proving itself very nicely, playing with a lot more fluidity. What a signing Gabriel has been for them.",1
"Arsenal's attack is so fluid and they're playing so well man, they're fr looking real dangerous this season.",1
All game the fans were loud and behind the team. Especially the Saliba chant. This team is different and they’re together. COYG,1
"It’s such a shame that the Gabriel Jesus goal was ruled offside :( he’s playing out of his skin at the moment and deserved that goal ,zinchenko played amazing today ,marteneli and Jesus are always a threat and xhaka has been playing well consistently under his new role and Ofc we gotta talk about saliba 😵‍💫🤩so young yet he plays like a veteran (special mention to Ben white who’s also been playing good at right back)",1
3 wins won’t guarantee us a top 4 finish but it’s better than 3 defeats!! Which is where we were last season!!,1
It's great to see Arsenal win the games they are supposed to win. Excited to see them against top 4 competition,1
Watching Gabriel Jesus in this team right now honestly puts such a huge smile on my face. Him and Odegaard just fit so well together and the interplay between them and the wings is just so fun to watch. Finally happy watching Arsenal play again.,1
"Compared to the same time last year, I feel like I'm living in the cloud 9. 3 games, 3 wins, 9 points, 9 goals scored with only 2 goals allowed. Can you believe that?

For ones like Tierney, Tomiyasu, and Smith Rowe who were main starters for Arsenal last season, we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by. I hope they can be patient, grab the opportunities, and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on. Compared to the last season, this is a huge improvement. The squad depth is so much thicker that we are using Tomiyasu, Smith Rowe, and Tierney as substitutes. Hopefully next week, I would like to see Vieira to make a debut even if it's just for 10 or 20 minutes.",1
Arsenal's got 3 Gabriels and all of them have been phenomenal,1
Tears in my eyes I prayed for these times of having a solid team,1
2 :32 what is even more amazing is that he used the support of his opponent’s shoulder to facilitate his own rotation in mid-air. I didn’t see it the first time either😱,1
1:13 That was the best golf shot I've ever seen.,1
I want more of these videos in my life. So enjoyable to watch sport at its very best.,1
1:14 No sport event anywhere in history can come near this one.... GOD HIMSELF,0
The last one wasn't great. It's a foul in footballing terms and always results in a yellow card. Other players have done the same and been booked for it too... As did Henry in that last clip,0
only a 5 hours after the game was over this time. that’s record speed!!! good job guys,1
That Diaz goal was reminiscent of his wonder goal vs Peru in the Copa Amer. In fact he scored like that a bunch of times for Porto too. Class player.,1
"Credit to Crystal Palace, that was a great counterattack before the goal, reminiscing of Brentford's 4th on Saturday.",1
"That Luis Diaz goal is an instant classic. As a Colombian, I could not be happier 🇨🇴",1
"Both goals scored were absolutely amazing, what a result for Palace, wish NBC could’ve uploaded this earlier though 😐",1
Milner was all over the pitch this game. This man still has it,1
"I love Luis Diaz so much, what a player, what a character.",1
"As a neutral fan, I’m really happy to see both Zaha and Diaz scoring! Both top tier players in the league.",1
"Luis Diaz has a big heart, sharp teeth, and an amazing attitude for Liverpool.  Sweetest of goals.",1
Luis Diaz always showing great character and ready to sacrifice anything for this team 👏👏,1
if this guy calls zlatan “zla-tan” one more time,0
The way you sync the whole video is just smoooooth 🤌🏻💥,1
That wind assist goal was amazing,1
"great video, great voice. Stay safe man, keep it up!",1
"1:26 King 👑 
Amazing video bro! Thank you😎🔥👍",1
"That love shared between Canelo and Plant man is something else. “You have a beautiful family, you are my family” I love this sport 🥊",1
"Plant and Canelo's post-fight talk is honestly one of the best moments I've ever seen. Great stuff before the bell, in the ring, and after the fight.",1
"Canelo and Plants speech gave me the chills man, he was truly sad he lost the fight",0
The fact that Jake and Logan are featured is hilarious to me,1
"its really great to see Canelo fight over the years and progress as a fighter. Enjoy him while you can fellas, boxing is in great hands.",1
"Wow, highlighting the conversation during the fight and after the fight was awesome. Classy for both fighters. Great job Showtime.",1
That exchange Canelo and Plant had was deep and with all due respect 🥇,1
"I like Jermell Charlo , I've  met him more than a couple of times and he's a cool guy but Castano won that fight IMO.",1
"Año de Canelo!
💪🏼🇲🇽⬆️",1
"Wow what Saul said after the fight made me tear up a little.  ""You are my family now"" respect.",1
"Part 2 coming soon! YouTube decided to cut my upload in half for some reason 🤷🏼‍♂️

So the rest of the video will be uploaded later this week 💪🏼🙏🏼",1
I love how in the first one he immediately turns to the penalty box like “I know the drill guys”,1
1:15 made me laugh way harder than it should have,1
"I love how at 2 minutes the thunder happens and the pitcher just drops everything and turns around like ""Nope. I'm gonna dip. Yall have fun.""",1
"I'm amazed at how players are able to react in the moment in ways that seem superhuman, and then sometimes they don't even react as if it was special.",1
"Dave Winfield of the New York Yankees accidentally hit and killed a seagull with a baseball in Toronto vs the Blue Jays, August 1983. He was charged with cruelty to animals and an autopsy was even done on the seagull. It created a lot of controversy here in Toronto.",0
"Worth watching,  worth sharing.  Excellent content.  Delivered as advertised.  Thank you!",1
"The Jags v Texans one always kills me. The DB did EXACTLY what you’re taught to do. Don’t go for the INT, just knock it down. Much more effective than trying to go up with an NFL-level receiver. Just so unlucky lmao",0
"Very entertaining, one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected.  I remember my wife was given a free ticket to a Diamondbacks game, which went zero/zero so she finally left and when she came home she said ""I got bored with the game"".  The Diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left, winning the game.  

I teased her endlessly after that, suggesting she should not attend more D-backs games, and they went on to win the world series that year, my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the Yankees and Luis Gonzalez base hit that won the game.

I met Joe Montana, and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl, and I saw the ending in French, in Montreal, in '90.   During my flight from SFO to Toronto and the connecting flight to Montreal, our Air Canada pilot gave us updates on a one-sided blowout.

I also will never forget the Stanford/Cal game in 82 and ""The Play"" when Cal beat Stanford, and the band became part of the game.  Some still argue over two of the lateral passes, but the win for Cal was as it was, and I still say, that is among the craziest moments in sports history.

My own crazy moment was when I was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team, even though I was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team, the school we played had no players above the sixth grade, so I agreed.  We won the game, though I had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game.  Adrenalin had me psyched, and our QB said I threw perfect spirals.  I would intimidate the bigger players since they feared I'd plow under them and stop them from getting to the QB, and they never did, he was not sacked.

Our team went on to win the Norcal championship, undefeated, in our twelve team league, my brother playing as wide receiver, though I no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders.  I never went on to play in high school, feeling I was too small to be as good as I was in my grammar school game, where I also played on the defense, and I stuck to distance cycling and golf, both of which I enjoyed and also had many ""crazy"" moments, and I was decent at the 440 as it was then, now the 400 meters.

Even in my early 60's now, and despite a leg I broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago, I still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing.

On my channel here @Cactus521 I even have a video of me jumping off the Vegas Stratosphere tower when I was 52, though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered, I felt peace, and not fear, on the way down, choosing that vs. skydiving as my free fall bucket list item, since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane. 😂",1
You know it’s a good game when there’s 20 minute highlights,1
"Kevin de bruyne is insane. 

Newcastle need to be taken seriously this season.",0
Saint Max on his day can break down any press man. Incredible so fun to watch. Definitely one of those “streets will never forget” kind of players,1
"It’s not even about the draw against the champions for me, it’s the way Howe has Newcastle playing, free, attractive, positive going forward football and no fear of great opposition. Wow. Genuinely love to see it.",1
"this game was insane, as much as a win would be satisfying, I would take a draw all day over a loss, respect to Newcastle, what an amazing game
Edit-1k likes……….idk how to feel about this lmao",1
Could've never predicted how amazing of a midfielder Joelinton has become,1
"My god, KDB is insane. His vision and passing skills are absolutely generational. Haven't seen anything like it since xavi and Sneijder",1
Well done Magpies. Saint-Maximin attacking with pace at Man City defense is a blue print for rest of EPL.,1
"Emotional day.

Haven't seen a Newcastle side play that well (against Man City no less) in a very long time. 

Gutted but grateful to get a point in the end.  Just a heroic team performance. Could single every player in the starting XI out for praise.  Just so proud of all of them.

As for City, I'll just say I clapped as soon as I saw De Bruyne had played Silva in on goal.  Just phenomenal football.  I mean, at times during that match, it was terrifying when City had possession.  A wonderful side and a wonderful manager.",1
"throwin’ it back to our old school trick shot days 🏸 🏀 🏈 ⚽️ ⚾️ 🎾 🥏🏐🥍
thanks for watching guys. we seriously appreciate you a ton",1
I see you Cody with those frisbee skills. I'm impressed!,1
"How has this not become a series yet?! Great job, dudes!",1
Man these all these trick shots are so dope. Wish I daily’s be like you guys in the future,1
"thanks coby for giving some love to badminton, i really love the sport and it feels great that you can shine a spotlight on it once in a while",1
"Can we just appreciate that they got a baseball field, football field, hockey rink and a soccer field just for one video.😄
 Edit: Thank you for all the likes, I’ve never gotten this many!",1
"""Shout out to all my badminton players out there i know your sport doesnt get alot of love""
Thats hits me right in the feels man, thank you",1
I loved the Garret in this video. He had SOOOOOOO much energy.,1
I know I’m not the only one going back during quarantine and rewatching all the dude perfect vids in fact they inspired me and I do my own trickshots on this channel!,1
"I always love seeing the coaches' reaction. Just celebrating someone else's success together feels good, even to watch.",1
Just saw Duplantis won the olympics.. he's definitely a legend.. making all those jumps to the gold medal & not a single fail.,1
"Fastest red card, the only world record I could achieve",1
"the world record that I remember with pleasure is the first (in a total of 11) of Federica Pellegrini in 2008. She was unjustly disqualified in the semifinal of her favorite race, the 200sl, so the next day she made the 400sl record. In her career she also made a couple of records the same day, but the first was particular.",1
One of the best races I have ever seen,1
"""The longest shot has won the Kentucky Derby"" gives me chills and make me smile what a quote and a race...",1
We'll probably never see something like this again. Legitimately one of the coolest things I've ever seen in my life.,1
"In all honesty, this might be the greatest Kentucky Derby victory of all time. The longest shot passes the favorite right at the end. You can’t write a story better than that.",1
I can’t get enough of this race. The way he says “RICH STRIKE!” in the end is legendary…,1
"That friggin horse looked like a running back cutting back and across mid-stride breaking for daylight, then breaking it open to the end zone! Awesome display of athleticism, horse and jockey.",1
"it’s such a treat seeing spectacles like this, good for Rich Strike…even if this horse does not win anymore, Rich Strike is in the history books",1
Rewatching this and watching Rich Strike the whole way knowing what’s about to happen and hearing the announcers reaction I got chills up and down my spine. What an unbelievable race!,1
ENJOY THE THUMBNAIL HAHAHAHAHAHA ;),1
Give that guy on the tennis court an A+ for attitude.. good sense of humor.,1
2:48 I would've dropped everyone around me😤,0
Love the videos Gonth! ♥️,1
Yo gonth love your channel and I love you vids they have been helping me through lockdown keep it up man 👊👊💪💪,1
"Correction, in South Africa, Kaiser Chiefs fans take it too far",0
The reason for the beach balls: in Israel a team that doesn’t play well is “going to the beach” so their fans threw beach balls because they sucks,0
The man hitting Grealish is my favourite clip man what a legend😂😂😂,1
"TEAM JESUS 🙏🏼💪🏼🕊

Comment down below if your on his winning team! 👇🏼",1
"I don’t know why, but the cop cheering for Papi’s home run always makes me laugh.",1
"I’ll never understand opposing teams not helping a player out(unawareness aside), such a stupid thing. Help each other out",0
I love how the cleanup crew beats the medical crew to do their job.,1
21:57  That guy was my best friend as a young kid.  We went to school together.  Great guy!  I will forever cherish this clip as teasing material.,1
That Golden State Warrior doing the splits always makes me laugh!! 😂😂😂😂,1
9:15 This father actually died from the fall trying to get his son a ball. So sad,0
Man at 7:10 got crossed so bad he did a split. Hilarious.,0
CRASHING ON HARD PLYWOOD FLOORS IN BASKETBALL = WORST..POSSIBLE..PAIN! :'(,0
"This is the type of video that I like showing one clip after another without five minutes of talk  and leadup to each one. Yes, we can figure them out all by ourselves. Good job.",1
"#41 That cheerleader got her head in the game. All puns intended 😂
Thank you for this video. They're all great!",1
The right side of the midfield is gonna be an absolute quagmire🤦🏾🤦🏾 Went right over my head😂,0
"Aaronson becoming a star is awesome to see, as well as Marsch’s slap handshake at the end.",1
Hopefully we stop hearing about how much trouble Leeds are in without Raphinha/Phillips/Bamford I love all 3 but we have replaced them well,1
"It’s crazy how nobody has mention how big Rodrigo been these past games, he is an amazing player before the prem and he is finally showing his potential that he had since his Valancia days.",1
I’ve been a huge Aaronson fan for a while now. Dude is an absolute lightning bolt and refuses to quit. Every time he plays for USMNT he provides a spark. Glad to see him doing well.,1
Very impressed with Leeds United so far. Love how Aaronson has no quit in him and has a lot of heart. Glad to see American players doing well in the Premier League with Aaronson and Adams. Hope they keep this up throughout the season!,1
What a freaking start for Jesse Marsch and the squad! Lets gooooo!,1
"Might not have world class quality, but they have world class commitment, pressing, and energy. Very fun and promising performance",1
Aaronson is a must start at the world cup,1
Finally Maguire used in a brilliant way. What a game for Harry! 👍🏻🙌🏻👏🏻,1
"God bless Ten Hag. Finally, MU has a manager with balls. I pray he gets time to implement his vision and philosophy.",1
"3 games in to the season might seem like a bit too soon to be worried about this Liverpool team but, the early indications are that the Liverpool midfield is literally paper thin when it comes to resources. As a long time LFC supporter I can't help but compare the decision to let Sadio Mane go to the same situation with Xavi Alonso some years back. I think that J. Klopp is going to have to put in some serious time working with this squad to get anywhere close to a top 4 position this year. Hope I am wrong but, if I am being honest Man. Utd should have been 4-0 up at halftime.",0
"They missed MANÈ and nobody wants to admitted ,sorry",0
Martinez is all of 6'4 in his 5'9 height.  A giant among giants,1
Three weeks in and the table is unrecognizable.,0
I’m not over excited because Man U usually turn up against the big teams. We are good at counter attacking but against teams that sit back is when we struggle.,1
"Love that Rashford didn’t make that first question about himself. Knowing he hadn’t any goal contributions in the prem in months he put the club first , class 🙌🏼👏🏼",1
"If Liverpool don't sign at least 2 players (midfielders) before the transfer window closes, making top 4 will be very difficult and as for VVD, looks like he is getting too complacent this season",0
Perisic has brought so much offensive danger to the wings for spurs. Which is deadly considering someone of Kane's quality waiting for those headers,0
"Not that impressed with how Spurs are controlling a game, but thoroughly impressed by their resolve and determination. 
Every game so far this season, they’ve faced stiff competition, and they keep rising to the challenge. It’s awesome to see, no matter where they go.",1
Really good response in the second half. Have to start games better if we want to win against the better teams though.,1
"Wolves are so close to being a top flight team.  However, glad to see Spurs come out on top.",1
"I feel as though Spurs is not overwhelmingly great compared to other top teams in bpl, but what makes them so deadly is their continuous pressure and effort which shows around 2nd half.",0
As a sad wolves fan I'm actually encouraged by how well they played.  After this start though I'm already scared,1
"Fun Fact;17 more goals to go and Harry Kane will become Tottenham's all time record goal scorer. Jimmy Greaves (1st with 266 goals, Kane 2nd with 250 goals)",1
the play at 12:06 suprised me hopefully jimenez regains his confidence and plays like this more,1
"I like Coby’s attitude, even though he fails a lot he’s always on the positive side. Keep on going Coby",1
"Ty is phaenomenal! Every time, I think ""No way he is finishing the last one"", but he really thrives under the pressure. His mentality is outstanding! But regardless of the outcome, each and every video is a massive team effort 💪",1
Whats most impressive is how the editors managed to extend a 3 minute song into 11 mins without sounding boring,1
"I've literally watched this dozens of times over the last 4 years, it's one of the best.",1
Videos never disappoint,1
"Whenever I see this video in my recommended I always have the urge to watch it, every single time. There's no stopping it. Anybody else have that?",1
5:11 combining the joke with Cody’s laugh makes this amazing lol,1
"Congratulations @Dude Perfect for reaching 100,000,000 views!",1
De Bruyne brilliant as always. Nice to see Haaland can get the assists as well as the goals.,1
"it’s crazy how much Haaland can affect the game even with few touches, his runs are always pulling players and opening up space for city to play. Once they start getting used to him being there for tap ins too, it’s gonna be even scarier",0
"Kevin De Bruyne, world class as usual. Haaland should've at least gotten on the scoresheet if Foden squared him in, but at least he got an assist. He can still find a way to contribute without goals.",1
"That first half was a master-class by KDB and that goal, using the outside of his foot, was terrific.",1
Foden can't do that BS. That was a tap in for Haaland,0
adam smith should have been given a red card,0
If I was Haaland  would have been pissed at Foden too.,0
Honestly you can’t even be surprised that Bauer acts the way he does. He grew up bullied by kids and adults who always told him he was nothing and worthless. That shit stays with you.,0
"""Will you make people stop cheating?""
""No""
""Alright, then I'm just going to openly use the method of cheating and tell anyone and everyone""",0
As someone who was bullied heavily as a kid I can see there's a few outcomes of that sort of situation. And one of them is people become complete antisocial assholes like Bauer.,0
"He literally said I’m going to cheat too if nobody wants to stop everyone else. He was the one who made it so public, and now we have umpires checking all the time.",0
MLB needs more players like Bauer. He’s entertaining and makes watching the game fun,1
04;57 - I did this playing soccer for my high school during a game. Very memorable and always fun to think back on.,1
bro you did my boy wrong by calling him talentless hippy 💀💀,0
The boat saving the balls is litteraly the GOAT,0
Bro the random dog on the soccer field stopping the goal like he’s airbud has me in tears. 😭,0

"I first heard this in the car with my mother and my sister, on a small obscure radio station. We had no idea what it was and we laughed so hard we had to pull over. One of my favourite memories.",1
this is non ironically one of greatest pieces of art i ever seen,1
These guys should play at the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics!,1
"The best part of this is that it's the offical video, but the vocals were clearly recorded live for this - it's not the recorded version in the album.  It's messy and it's awesome.",1
"one of my favorite songs my old roommate/bestfriend and I would scream at the top of our lungs, drunk out of our minds.. ill miss you everyday oliver.. RIP",1
This is the ideal male body. You may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like.,1

"Liverpool is such a disappointment, even scrubs like Man U can get the better of them. SMH.",0
Hate these stupid zoom conferences,0
Congrats Winnipeg open and jr open programs,1
I hope they keep adding sports. Always had a blast with boxing.,1
"This game looks fantastic! It originally seemed like a barebones sequel to the wii games, but it's shaping up to be a really fun experience. Character customization, tons of modes, great music and visuals, online, and free updates? I'm happy.

Hopefully more sports will be added beyond golf. I'd love to see baseball and boxing make a return.",1
"This game looks great, I can't wait to play it! The badminton especially looks like it will be a lot of fun, and the survival bowling is such a cool idea. Will definitely be buying this when it comes out :)",1
"When it comes to in game customization, I go crazy for it!  So far, from what I’ve seen if that in this game, I’m super hyped!!",1
"I absolutely LOVED baseball in Wii so I hope it comes as a DLC. Since Golf is coming, I really hope they continue adding sports.",1
It’s crazy how this is my most-anticipated game right now. I always wanted a more fleshed out version of Wii Sports and this looks to be it. Hopefully we get some of the resort sports added later on..,1
"I mostly want this due to the customization. I would love to see some Nintendo themed outfits in the game, maybe as prizes for online events. It would be cool to wear Splatoon outfits, or dress up as Mario characters for example.",1
"Would be cool to see more sports getting in the game via updates. Would love to see Waterpolo, Surfing, Kayaking as water based sports, Ice Hockey, Skiïng and snowboarding as winter sports. But also skating, skateboarding, basketball, baseball as more summer based sports. I could see a very special potential for other uses for the leg strap, like keeping in balance in surfing and snowboarding, making a triangle shape to break in skiïng and do some tricks like flips in skateboarding.",1
one of the biggest things i had against this game was the lack of Mii's but its nice to see that they're here. I will definitely buy this game!,1
"i hope they add more sports, i feel like a lot of the current ones are pretty similar so it would be nice to see some new ones come in",1
That girl chugging the beer is pretty loyal lol,1
LOVE IT! I JUST COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING!,1
I can't stop laughing with all those cute animals on the field 😅,1

"Thank you for the lack of basketball ""highlights"".",0
Loved the season opener look back. As a kid who went the games with my Pops. He worked at BYU his entire career. 40 years+ always had season tickets. My Dad passed away last October with a long painful battle with cancer. With all the ugly evil things going on on the world. BYU football & Basketball was our time to just hangout and enjoy being together. Although my Dad was a little to crazy dealing with traffic and parking 😆😆,1
"TEAM JESUS 🙏🏼💪🏼🕊

Comment down below if your on his winning team! 👇🏼",1
Finally!!! Finally a properly done highlight video!! No annoying commentating and no useless history on the players or the plays. Play after play after play! Awesome job!!,1
The Simpson flip really is incredible.  Looks like something you'd see in a movie about someone gaining super powers and taking advantage of it by playing football.,1
"I’m not a golf fan, but that putt is one of the most impressive things I’ve ever seen in sports.",1
"I thought I was going to end up skimming or closing out this video early, but this video was very well edited.  I was hooked on each play back to back without feeling bored.  The audio also was well balanced too and didn't have to worry about the next play being too loud or too soft.  Just like what drummer386 said a couple months ago..  ""Awesome job!!""",1
"Also, the missed free throw by Steven Adams to get the rebound and IMMEDIATELY know where Westbrook was to pass it to him was AMAZING. He knew EXACTLY where he was, and they were able to get a shot off from the miss before the other team even knew what happened lol",1
"*has one of the most incredible plays in golf ever*

Commentators: wow… nice.",1
3:36 Never gets old. The very definition of situational awareness,1
That forward flip where he partially vaults off the other player is amazing. Even if you could practice for a thing like that it'd still be hard to pull off.,1
Doesn’t matter who we buy at this point. Once they’re here they’ll regress beyond recognition.,0
"I think Casemiro is a quality player and a quality singing. I don’t believe he’ll be ‘unmotivated’ because he’s won everything. 
He’s a world class CDM which we need. But it’s madness that we’ll be paying that money for him at this point in the window. Crazy. It reeks of absolute desperation.",0
"Quality player is Casemiro & also a DM which we've cried out for. The concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at Madrid? We are said to pay him an eye-popping 400k a week is what I've heard & that's typical United, one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable, unmotivated players who we then can't move on when it's time. As I say, quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but won't helps us achieve anything substantial. As for Pulisic, I've always been quite underwhelmed by him, albeit you can see he does possess good quality. I probably wouldn't be averse to a loan though, it can't be any worse than banging our heads against a brickwall hoping Rashford does anything productive every week.",0
"The reality is that, when he was at Ajax, Ten Hag didn't choose the players. At Ajax they have a solid recruitment area full of great ex players.... At Manchester United.....🤷‍♂️",1
"We are a absolute mess. If Casemiro was the target why wasn't he signed 2 months ago?. We just panic and buy whoever with no strategy man. Im not saying Casemiro is a rubbish player, he is quality. Its just Man Utd's approach to signings is a joke. Plus im not overly keen on giving a 30 year old a 5 year contract at 250k a week. ( but ill literally take anything over Scott and Fred ).",0
Casemiro would be a fabulous signing for us i can’t bear to watch McTominay play again,1
"United have 2 big transfer problems right now

1   literally everyone in Football knows how bad   the situation is  at United  and it means  alot of good players are simply going to refuse to go here regardless how much money we offer them Haaland is a good example 

2  the players we can get  the Clubs they play for know  how desperate we are and are naturally gonna jack up the price  to get as money money as possible",0
"West ham look terrible thus far 
Graham Potter is doing incredible things at brighton",0
Brighton is the team people are actually sleeping on...they're in a good standing at the moment but nobody is paying attention,0
Don't sleep on brighton. I would like to see them in Europe one day.,1
Brighton looking good even though they lost couple good players,1
"Moi and Pervis and hopefully if Sarmiento picks his level up , I hope these three Ecuadorian men play together . They sure will do a high offensive playing style .",1
"Brighton doing everything right, very good team",1
Probably the best game I've seen from Harry Maguire in a long time. His absence from the game was pivotal in United's win.,1
"ten Hag was on the pitch 45 minutes before the warmup, placing cones and balls in precise spots.  His body language was full of intensity and concentration.  He looked like a man on a mission.",1
"This is a good coach. He's clearly a floor general and knows how to drive results. This is the guy you want you to lead your team, especially if they have been so ill-disciplined like United has for the last few years. If this was basketball, he is the type of point guard you want. He's got excellent standards and definitely the mindset of a champion.",1
"As a Liverpool fan I have to say that I admire how Ten Hag approached this game, he is great to listen to. Honest and intelligent. Not afraid to leave out some big egos for the greater interest of the team, respect!",1
"Ten hag has found the best position for maguire
Not a single forward passed him
Not a single mis passed ball
Not a single foul
Not a single defensive error leading to goal
Keep it up maguire",1
so refreshing to have a manager who's not afraid to make big decisions,1
The tactical position of maguire was class 🔥,1
I loved Ten Hag's comment the other day about he has always had slow starts at every club he managed but he always got the job done. He has total belief in himself & it showed on the pitch last night that the players have belief now too!,1
"""I've been down my whole life, and now look at me now.. LOOK AT ME NOW!""

God those words... 
tears are speaking",0
That “look at me now” gave me chills. It really shows what he has been through to get there. Big congratulations,1
"“Look at me now!” What an iconic speech, the whole thing.",1
"The most amazing thing about this is how Leon shone on the mic. He's never been regarded as much of a talker, but this might be best post fight interview ever. it's got it all, cold one liners, tear jerking passion, a roaring crowd and bedlam in the stadium. watched this so many times already.",1
"So many people said Edwards didn't even deserve the shot. Most underrated, most disrespected fighter in the sport. Casuals with opinions. Baffling. Look at him now! Leon Edwards is the quintessential gray man/ dark horse. He does not train at altitude and EPO dope so the altitude really affected his output throughout the fight. The headkick was well read and calculated. Incredible.",0
"Every time he says ""Look at me now""  I feel it. 

Happy for him  🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲",1
Leon has done the uk proud. All the hurdles he’s had in his career. All the doubters and to silence everyone and beat the p4p number 1 was great to see 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿,1
"This has me HYPED for work!! About to clock in and scream “You’s all thought I’d be late! Look at me now!” 

Congrats Leon!",1
The name “Rocky” couldn’t possibly be more fitting. Absolutely amazing win faced with such adversity.,1
"its amazing how arsenal is finally playing so well they don't have to rely on running the game though saka. Saliba, Jesus, and Zinchenko are also such a fresh injection to this team",1
Can we get a second season of All or Nothing with Arsenal?!! I would love to see how players are reacting behind the scenes.,1
Xhaka as a player summarizes Arsenals rebirth. Absolutely love that we kept him,1
Tim Howard just keeps getting better and better as a pundit. Wasn’t impressed by him at first but he’s slowly growing on me.,1
For once in a very long time it feels great to be a gooner,1
"The fans support of Saliba is unreal, going back to the own goal last week. The whole fan base wants him to succeed, he could have an amazing career!",1
Arteta finally getting some credibility. If Partley stays healthy and Jesus keeps his form Arsenal can challenge city for the title.,1
The result is better than what was expected.  Arsenal are performing better than anticipated.  The next actual challenge is Villa.  Not Man U.,1
Can we get a second season of All or Nothing with Arsenal?!! I would love to see how players are reacting behind the scenes.,1

Such an awesome collection of cars for this year’s CAR magazine Sports Car Giant Test – but which is your favourite? Comment below…,1
A collection of brilliant cars but I would go for the GT4RS. You can't beat a high revving normally aspirated engine.,1
"GT4RS with the McLaren a very close second for me.I simply believe the Porshe is way more versatile and at the same time affordable too ,whilst putting the same smile on my face.",1
Great video guys. This channel definitely deserves more subs than a lot of other car review channels. Its the GT4RS for me here with the 296 a close second.,1
Well done Car magazine. But I will take Porsche. State of art on wheels.,1
Wonderful group of cars. I would have a tough time choosing between the Lotus & GT4RS. I thought the color combo on that Ferrari was in poor taste. It does not look good to my eyes.,0
"I feel like the 765 doesn’t belong in this list at all, almost unfair",0
"I'd love any of those with the exception of the Lotus, in this company it looks outclassed in every department. For me, the one that offers the best combination of performance, desirability, and of being obtainable would be the Maserati.",1
"How gorgeous is the MC20 in comparison to the 296? I love the rear 3/4 of the 296 but it's just ugly from the front. The MC20 with a MC12 livery would be my choice I think, would need the OPF's removed though to get some better sound out of it... or the Lotus and pay off my house :P :P",1

Impossible not to love mitrovic. He plays with so much passion,1
"Two teams with two classic CF players. Strong, physical and dominant in the air. Great match. Premier league needs more strikers like Mitrovic and Toney.",1
Mitrovic just sores up on headers.. it’s nearly unstoppable for smaller players,1
"Fulham could easily stay up, along with Forest.",1
First goal for Brentford was a masterpiece. Loved it. Mitrovic is a killer,1
Everyone doubted Fulham but they’re looking favorites to stay up!,1
Ivan Toney's Mitro celebration probably a lil awkward now,0
As A Spurs Fan: Congrats Fulham and I Hope You Play Another Priemer league Next Season To Survive,1
He’s playing in goal for my team any day. However many legs he’s got. I don’t care. I love this man,1
That one legged goalie is teaching us more than any other video on Youtube,1
The Vasy clip was a normal game for him. That's The Big Cat!!! Go Bolts!!!,1
That 1 lag man 😭😭 absolutely legend hats off melt my heart..,1
Really awesome moments. Great video,1
"We were doing back-Hans sweeps in waterpolo when I was in HS. Nothing spectacular, other than we were strong.",1
"3:33 as per George Carlin, I believe that shot is worth 25 points.",1
The cyclist was incredible. Made me jump out of my seat.,1
"Gabriel Jesus has seriously fit into this squad like a glove ,two goals and two assist is amazing .saka looked a bit quiet today but it’s probably due to his fitness not being up to speed this early on ,zinchenko did good and marteneli fried fofona who looks like he’s about ti go for 80 mill..If we get another signing I’ll be happy .this team is looking very promising",1
Love the start of this season so far. Arsenal need to keep their confidence up in order to take control over games and win them. COYG!,1
You can still see how Saliba is solid even after the miscommunication mistake . What a gem .,1
"The fans clapping for Saliba after the own goal said it all for me, the fans are behind this group. Great win, the score line could’ve been much higher. COYG!",1
"Gabriel Jesus has been amazing for Arsenal. He's merged quickly into this Arsenal side, playing magnificently. Arsenal, by the looks of it, have a good season ahead of them.",1
The chemistry and youth of this Arsenal squad is crazy. Top four finish this year and if they improve even further then they'll definitely compete with City and Liverpool next season.,1
"Xhaka had a really good game. Criticize him when it’s justified, no doubt. But you also have to praise him when he deserves it. Goal + assist",1
"Gabriel Jesus really showing Pep that they didn’t need to look for anyone “better”, he’s pure class at any club he goes to",1
"Will be interesting to see how far arsenal’s defense will take them this year, they have plenty of offense",1
"I love how the Arsenal Fans applauded Saliba when he scored an own knowinng that if that ball goes beyond him to Vardy it is a goal, best fans in the PL",1
That looks delicious ♡,1
Thank you so much for this! I've always wanted to make one of these!,1
"10/10 very basic instructions, tasted Incredible.",1
This is a great video! More people should know about this wonderful recipe.,1
This is my favorite meal! It’s too delicious that I needed to go to the doctor to check how to remove it from my stomach because tasted very delicious that my stomach didn’t work well,1
"Thank you so much! I can now make this anytime to eat, delicious 😋!!!",1

That's a wonderful opportunity of learning and motivation especially in this trending phase of the influence of technology in our lives😇 Thankyou so much🙏😊,1

It’s almost 4am and it’s a perfect time to learn how to make every sushi,1

"I love how the hosts are not only masters of their craft, they also look so happy in the process",1
The respect he shows every ingredient is amazing. Sushi is part art and part food in my eyes. Every step is so precise.,1
I'm never going to attempt to do homemade sushi but loved watching a true master of his craft do it.,1
Taka might just be my favourite chef that’s been on this channel (which is impressive since I have many other favourites!) He’s so engaging and I felt so welcome to try out what he’s teaching us. I’d love more videos with him!,1
such elaborate techniques! I've been trying to make rolls for a while with not much success (they're delicious but unsightly lol) and it will be very interesting trying to recreate at least some of these,1
"i've seen a lot of content on sushi making (and eating) over the decades and this was by far one of the most profound and stuffed with knowledge! great content! (even though the closed captions apparently didn't know what a sinew is and made it a sinu, whatever that is.)",1
Perfect timing - just tried making sushi for the first time last night.,1
HAPPY SUNDAY EVERYONE! After finishing my living room makeover to wanted to go over some common living room design mistakes I see and how to fix them!! I hope this gives you some tips and ideas you can apply in your living room!!💗,1
I know I love mismatched furniture! One of the ways I’ve been looking to accomplish this is by using slip covers! Amazon has some great ones with a variety of colors and patterns! (And very affordable! 😉),1
"Love your videos Kristen, so brilliantly put together and such a lot of fantastic tips. Thank you very much ☺️",1
Hi Kristen. In your videos you've talked about grounding your furniture by using a large rug which looks great. What if I have carpet? Is there anything I would need to incorporate to make the furniture appear grounded in this situation? 😊,1
I would love some tips to decorate a  small but high ceiling living room! It's been a struggle to find inspiration!,1
"Hi, Kristen, I love your design tips. My husband is insisting on getting a recliner sofa. Can I mix them with fabric accent chairs ? And do the furniture in the living room have to be of same height ?",1
Love the advice you give! This is something I need to do in my living room! Nice work!,1
Love your contents. Will definitely consider your tips in my room design journey! Thanks a bunch.,1
"Great video as always.  Loved the TV nestled within the gallery wall. Good idea. Also, I love every opportunity to look at your living room.  You did a fabulous job on that room. One of my favorites .",1
"Kristen, you're like the only YouTuber I constantly watch! I feel like I connect with you in so many ways!",1
"He's right. I've always loved studying the gestures and language of appealing characters and I come across as confident most of the times, to the point where people are surprised when I tell them I have anxieties and various inner struggles like we all do. It's not about feeling perfect, it's about knowing you deserve to be where you're at and accepting that you might feel uncomfortable at times.",1
"I think ""fake it till you make it"" is really important when it comes to confidence. You need to practice it in order for it to start coming naturally. Appearing confident, even when you don't feel confident, I believe, can prevent confrontation or becoming a victim (in some circumstances).",1
"Honestly I feel like confidence comes naturally when you care about something so much that you are no longer sensitive to how people see you and how you appear in front of others. Like Jane Goodall or Colin Powell - I'm a person that has a mission that's important to me, plus huge experience and knowledge that built me, and I'm proud, and what the world thinks is not my concern.",1
"""confidence can be very quiet"" - finally someone said it, thank you!",1
I was born confident and as a little girl I was constantly scolded for being too bold or outspoken. Now I own it again and found joy in life like when I was true to myself.,1
"The presenter here delivers his knowledge succinctly. He IS the example of what he is teaching. Thank you for a concise,  no extraneous lesson.  It is has been immensely helpful.",1
"I have ADHD so usually it's hard for me to focus on talks, speeches and so on. But when someone is really good at speaking and confident about what they're saying, I tend to pay more and even full attention. I paid full attention to this video and even remember what I learned after watching only once. This is my 2nd time here! Just to make sure I don't forget :)",1
To me confidence means being happy with who you are. Having that inner peace with the person you are.,1
This guy's body language tells me that he is uncomfortable with this interview and that he is withholding information.,0
He’s definitely someone who can make you admit everything just by his personality,1
"I'm glad that those ""signs"" he laid out at the beginning were myths. I've put so much effort over the years into avoiding showing these signs by accident so I don't come across as untrustworthy, and when I do them by accident I always felt like I'm somehow maliciously deceiving people or myself without knowing about it. This puts my mind at ease - self-soothing, if you will",1
god his children must’ve had such a hard time lying to him,0
"The guy is giving a simplified summary for total beginners and people think it is an exact account if the methods they use. Agents have spoken with innocent and guilty people, their knew how to account for simple nerves and a guilty person. They know how to establish a baseline to account for individual traits. And most importantly, none of this can be used too convict you. They can't just say ""yep he's the murderer, he is lying"" and throw you in prison. It is just a tool to help then when interrogating so they can have an idea if when they are being lied too, or who they should focus on. They still need to investigate and find actual  PROOFV to convict you. If you didn't do it, they can't convict you just because you seemed like you were lying.",0
This is the most interesting thing I've seen in a long time. I can feel this guy's passion and attention to detail. The way he described seeing pertinent nonverbals jumping out at you as if a caricature when played at double speed was INCREDIBLY perceptive. I'm so intensely interested in this individual and his affinity to human behavior.,1
"my dad was a Drill Sargent in the Army, he had the ability to read people's behavior like this..it was unnerving to have him explain my behavior to me",0
I’m honestly starting to get the impression that being a French woman means putting 100% of your energy into being the sexiest woman in the room but then pretending you don’t try at all,0
"I lived 2 years in Paris and I used to observe a lot in the metro their outfit. I noticed that blue, beige and grey were the colors most used to dress, no patterns, only simple color. So simple and stylish at the same time. It is the opposite of us Italians. We like be noticed by accessories or colors. I prefer the French Style",1
"I love what Camielle said about french girls finding what suits them, their body, and what they like and dressing according to that. Not following trends but buying staple pieces that will fit your wardrobe and last a long time. I really love that. Fast fashion has ruined our sense of style. Some people only buy a piece because it's ""trendy"" then the trend passes and they forget about that item and throw it out and the cycle continues with the next trend...",1
"“It’s nice to have a bag that doesn’t scream designer” well I have a wardrobe full of clothes that don’t even whisper designer                                                     



   

(Y’all it makes me so happy that I made you laugh 💖)",1
I bet a lot of French people are rolling their eyes at this.,0
"I love how they are like actual friends; talking over each other, interrupting each other, not listening, the little laughs. I love it",1
"she's so on point with French styles, they don't follow trends, but stay to the classics with some accents of edginess or accents of new trends, but the root is classic and simple",1

True.

I don't have time = It is not a priority
Time is a choice, it is elastic.
We have enough time, almost all of us. Make the experiences enjoyable, such as, you can read or listen to a book while commuting. 

Get rid of things that take away most of your time on a daily basis. 

Focus on what matters and you will build the live you want",1
"Make yourself a three-category priority list for the coming week: career, relationships, self and there should be 2-3 items in each category, small moments can have great power. you can use your bits of time for bits of joy. Even if we are busy we have time for what matters. (quoting her)",1

"I know at least 5 ways to deal with them:

1. Never take their words personally. Always have this suspicion in mind, that they do not wish good for you, so you shouldn't trust their opinion of you.
2. Don't compete with them. It is futile and drains your energy.
3. If they attack you, stay calm, indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment. The odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative.
4. Don't become them. If they are negative, be positive. If they lie, tell the truth. If they speak behind your back, speak to their face. Always lead with example, because they might not simply have the skills to do that.
5. Do not trust them. Don't tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you. Keep your distance and value your boundaries. Protect yourself.",0
"Repeat after me:

It's safe to set boundaries with difficult people.
No matter what they say or feel, I am safe.",1
"This only works if all people involved are reasonable. If one or more parties can't be reasoned with, then the problem continues. You can communicate until you're blue in the face, but if the other person isn't willing to communicate appropriately, then you've hit a brick wall.",0
"""Their bad behavior shouldn't be the cause of your heart-attack.""
Brilliant!",0
"Cannot communicate with sociopaths on any reasonable level. People who cannot empathize will never see things from your point of view. Someone who is a sociopathic master manipulator can only be dealt with by affecting what matters most to them, money. Unfortunately, office sociopaths who gaslight daily rarely get reprimanded. They have everyone else in the office convinced they are wonderful and that you are the problem. Best solution is to remove yourself from that environment.",0

It was never enough for her to show love, only maybe enough to prevent the threats of leaving or avoid hearing that I was a complete failure.

I love how his videos are so calm and nice for the first minute and then he realizes he didnt do it right and it turns into destruction,0
The amount of effort this guy puts in his videos is insane,0
"Thank you! I was having a hard time fixing my laptop, but now it works WAY better than before. This helped out a lot.",1
I’m so glad I watched this tutorial. It actually helped,1
Worked so well! Thanks or the tutorial!,1
I'm using the same laptop that had this issue and it wants to thank you for saving it's life. This was also really helpful for alot of my computors too.,1
"Hey, some time ago I got my new ASUS laptop with AMD Radeon. But today I spilled water on it! So I searched up How to fix a water damaged laptop and your video had 50M views, so I clicked on it. And it worked perfectly! I fixed my laptop in 5 minutes without any problems! After doing every steps, I pressed on the power button and it started up without any problems. Thank you master for saving my life, without you I would be dead. Oh and my dad finally came back with the milk!",1
"this worked so well, thanks so much for these tips i followed every single step very very VERY carefully, thanks so much!",1
This video is so uplifting. It has my full support.,1
I like how serious you are when teaching us.,1
"This is fantastic!  After dropping my assistant hundreds of times, she'll be relieved that there is a way to actually do this without getting hurt, and those high velocity fans were always so expensive and unpredictable.  Always had to make sure the polarity was right.  Went through several assistants.  No more!  Thank you!!!",1
My respect to magicians even more bcs even if I know the way the tricks are done when they do it so smoothly and beautiful it's pleasure to watch them,1
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance-wealth, a great career, purpose-is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life..",1
Thanks a lot for sharing all these tricks with us for free. You are really great.,1
All the dislikes were magicians that are mad that u revealed there big secret lol,0
"Wow! That is fantastic! Thank you for sharing and disclosing this valuable 
secret. I always thought that levitation was a real skill that some possess.",1
These tricks are really great. Even in this day and ag with YouTube. And magic being exposed. It still amazes a huge amount of the population. Even the hoop trick. I knew how that was done. But it still looked convincing seeing it again,1
"I watched this a year ago. It completely changed my life. Got rid of 15 years of depression, loneliness. Lost 15 kilos of weight, got 1200 metres more to my cooper test, turned my company from the gates of bankrupcy into profit, estiblished 3 more companies. Not been sick once after this. Basically addicted myself to the positive.",1
"KNOWLEDGE IS POWER, BUT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOURSELF IS SELF EMPOWERMENT ☝️",1
"When I did cord cutting, meditate in my sleep every night, every morning when I wake up, before or after lunch and as needed, I was able to let go of obsessing over thoughts, anxiety and memories with strong emotions attached. So true what he’s saying. Can’t wait to see how far this goes, I’m just getting started. This is healing, this is what healthy living is.",1
I highly suggest listening to this multiple times. Each time I listen to this it hits different my understanding expands.. hope this helps someone…,1
"The more you know about yourself, the stronger a position you'll be in to make your life what you want it to be.",1
"To everybody reading this: ""May you achieve whatever you want.""",1
"I suffered from massive hairfall for 2 years, nothing worked but now m becoming positive and changing my thoughts and m so happy . My hairfall is significantly reduced and m experiencing massive hair growth❤️",1
I watch and listen to this message at the moment of writing. I hope this powerful message can change me to live in new world. Not thinking and living in the past!,1
"Dr. Joe is absolutely brilliant, life changing. I've been doing the meditations for 3 months now every day and can really feel a difference. I was very stressed and suffered from anxiety and this is just beyond amazing. Thank you Joe, thank you thank you thank you, need more people like you on the planet",1
Have a damn good day,1
"The thief is so smart in this game, it was almost like Cinema Summary was guiding him throughout this entire death game",1
i love how in the triangle room game instead of just ignoring the dumbest person in the room they used his imagination and creativity to figure out the solution,1
This guy’s definetly a genius.,1
"The best thing I started doing to wake up is to leave my phone on my desk across the room, so I can't be on my phone before bed and I have to stand up to turn off my alarm. Just forcing myself to stand up in the morning stops me from snoozing my alarm.",1
"Just so you know, I'm from Brazil and this video saved me. Thank you. Finally the algorithm got the recommendation right!",1
"I was constantly exhausted no matter how much I ate or slept. It was affecting my job, my workouts at the gym, even my free time. I felt terrible, like I was sick or something. I finally went to the doctor and found out I had an iron deficiency, so my doctor put me on supplements and offered me an infusion and I feel so much better! So it's definitely worth getting bloodwork done and going to the doctor's on top of all these great tips :)",1
"My thing has been the shifting of schedules to match my chronotype. Just.. the violence of waking up at 6h30 was unbearable for me. And when I went to college and picked classes that started at 10 at the earliest, it was a game changer. I am not sleeping more hours (maybe less hours even, because college), but I am never truly tired anymore.",0
"I’m a nurse & I work Night Shift, but even working nights, following these tips is so important for me! Some people think I’m crazy for staying on a night schedule even on my days off, but it’s like you said, it’s so hard on your body to not just stay on one schedule! My blackout curtains, sleep mask, & extended release melatonin are my best friends after a shift & a hot shower!",1
There was one single semester in undergrad that I was able to set my schedule up so that everyday I had a class start at 10:00 a regular lunch break and evening classes that ended by 6. And my dorm happened to be a single with a LOT of windows and natural light. Having a consistent schedule that matched my night owl rhythm and light regulation was the best sleep I ever felt (it was also the most consistent I’ve ever been in the gym since quitting high school sports) Followed by a semester where classes started at either 8:30 or 2pm on alternate days and my worst semester both grade and mental-health wise,1
"I have PTSD and clinical depression, so I always feel tired. I've been subjected to things I wouldn't wish on anyone, and even that was way easier than trying to get out of bed is for me now.

Please take care of yourselves, treatment for depression is very effective. Don't worry about potential side effects, because one very common side effect of depression is that you pass away.",0
"Great advice, all of it! I'm one of those you mentioned near then end, with a medical condition. Sleep isn't rejuvenating for some, no matter how much we get. Working towards good sleep habits is still helpful, as it regulates our lives and helps us pace what minimal energy we have, so if you're reading this comment, no matter if you're chronically ill like I am, or just a tired person without a debilitating illness, practice good sleep habits. Be patient - it'll help.",1
Just what I've been looking for.,1
Love how to survive 💖 useful,1
"Do a video on how to survive planet earth, it's a fact that 100% of humans have died there, so it would be nice to know how to survive it.",0
This will be useful for future,1
I am almost at my 20th hour of watching TEDx talks and I have to say I AM getting pretty good at this.,1
"This is 110% correct. Looking back on every skill I've learned and accounted my hours for, it is around the 15 - 20 hour range that I feel ""I got the hang of this"" and that the dream isn't foolish, but by practice and repetition, the perception becomes reality.",1
"""The main barrier is not intellectual - it's emotional"" was taken to heart. Thanks for the video",1
10:30 - 11:15 is the life changing quote for me. Trying to be a perfectionist at everything and eventually procrastinating is the thing that I'm doing over these years. Thank you 💖,1
"What I learned is: we need to be able to deconstruct the skill, and learn enough to self assess our progress eliminating diseraction while practice time, and put our 20 hours .This was so excellent.",1
"The best, most exciting, most practical, most fascinating Ted talk that I continue to come back to you again and again. Read the book multiple times, applied it to everything from learning a new language to fixing up my house, to now developing my skills as a ham radio operator. Thank you so much for this.",1
This makes learning something more digestible instead of getting overwhelmed by the task. So right. Wish I watched this earlier in my life :’-),1
"Love it! Put 20 hours practice in it and have fun!
Thinking about my karate journey 2hrs×10weeks here I am feeling much more comfortable compared the stressful emotion at the middle.
Now the next learning is about C++ programming for a R5 module problem.

Love the idea of self-correction milestone.
And the dedication of 20 hours practice. 

My comment about the 20 hours is that it's just the practice time, it doesn't include 3 also very important things, the preparation time, the decomposing time, and the reflection time.",1
"I know you don't read your comments Gordon, however I've just 'practiced' making rice and it turned out better than anticipated! 50g of rice and 150ml of cold water and I followed the method you described. You did say 8 to 10 minutes and I gave it 9. The result was extremely satisfactory and I combined it with some leftovers and have had a lunch with no waste. I know how to do the onion as my daughter has already shown me. I'm off out shortly to buy a steel as I usually sharpen my knife on a whetstone, which can be more of a chore than using a steel. I'm 61 and everyday is a schoolday.... I've so wanted to master rice:-) Cheers!",1
"Amazing energy, He makes me actually want to cook, his enthusiasm is contagious and this just pasta and simple stuff, can't imagine the level of passion he exudes on a complicated dish.",1
I would trust Gordon Ramsay with my life 24/7! It's like everything he does he just does it with purpose and he gives it 110% each time!,1
"one of the reasons I like Gordon is he seems genuinely enthusiastic about cooking, and super happy to teach you what he knows. His vibe isn't 'ooh I'm a fancy chef I know better than you' it's 'cooking is fun! let's do it together! you did something I've never tried? How cool!!'",1
"This is the first video I've saw before I started cooking more frecuently. Thanks Gordon, you're a great teacher.",1
"This is the first video I've saw before I started cooking more frecuently. Thanks Gordon, you're a great teacher.",1
I love how excited he is to cook straight up rice. True love for cooking,1
Thanks for teaching us all of these my mom really needed to know how to make the perfect pasta and you helped so much,1

"About to take the plunge into FBA, and these videos have helped tremendously. Wishing everyone here the best of luck!",1
"Hi Jatz, thank you for another valuable video. Question: What if Amazon tells me to request for an approval to list a product? This is after step where I search over ASIN number and choose condition of the product. It tells me to attach invoice for at least 10 items so it means I have to have the product already bought in order to proceed with any listing.",1
"Hi Jatz hope you’re well , I’ve found lots of helpful advice from watching your videos, do you have any videos/advice on FBM rather than FBA?",1
"Hi jatz I am having a problem with the competition, can u help how to avoid automatic price drop to buy box",0
Hi Jatz!  I'm a new subscriber of yours due to the fact that your videos are the best! I'm interested in fba wholesale and I'm finding loads of value in your wholesale videos..thanks so much😊,1
"Hey Jatz, nice to have you back after you went missing for a month (on youtube), how did the event go with Sunil Patel (student loan millionaire). looking forward to watching that, anyway glad your back because i need all the advice i can get as a new FBA member who haven't sold anything yet? ☹",1
This is one of my favorite blogging videos to film every year 😊  Hope you enjoy & happy blogging!!,1
Love your honesty! I started a blog in college too (Roll Tide) but that was 2009! I was never really consistent until now! Your videos helped me realize how important consistency is 👏👏,1
"Thank you so much for sharing all of your tips and tricks! You are seriously such an inspiration. I am currently trying to start my own blog, and it is harder than I thought it would be to juggle school, work and starting a blog . I am so grateful for your content, and everything that you share!",1
Sophia you are such an inspiration!! Thank you for being radically honest and giving tips that are actually very helpful. I've been binging your content and plan on building a blog this year. Cheers to 2022!! Let's get this bread!,1
"One of my favorite video series, please keep them coming.  You're such an inspiration to a lot of people.  I'm in the middle of starting and re-starting my blog / social media presence.  My biggest downfall is consistency but hopefully now that my little one is in school I'll have more time!! Thank you again love love love your blog and videos - they truly motivate me.",1
Watching your videos feels like taking a great course in itself! Thanks Sophia 😊,1
You are right about Pinterest- I have #60K monthly visitors and only now starting a  blog and looking for advice- and I agree about the classes and also learning from others- are are already successful and implementing their strategies to your blog. Well done! I wish I had had the capability to start a blog- when I was in college #80s girl. TY Sophia- beautiful presentation & easy to understand - your points are well made.,1
Love love your courses BTW!!! I highly recommend anyone to do it if you are on the fence about it. This is our year babes!!  P.S. Sophia I’d love to see more videos about your design biz. <3,1
The most genuine and real advice about blogging I have found. Seriously so encouraging and straightforward!,1
Believing that no matter what happens you’re going to be fine anyway is always a great mindset to have,1
"""You'll stop worrying that someone will reject you because you'll never reject yourself.""  That is brilliant! Well done!!!",1
"Realizing that no matter what happens, I'll be okay, is exactly how I survived my childhood. I used to stress so much then after so many dramatic plot twists, I realized if I survived all that, I will survive whatever else comes my way and that's when I stopped stressing as much. I hadn't really connected it with confidence before but I can see the connection now. Interesting. 🤔",1
"One thing this video misses, and probably the one most important thing is that confidence comes from within. You can stand in any way you want, dress as fancy as you like and have enough money to make king Solomon blush, but if inside you’re still insecure the world will see it. Love yourself, know you’re worthy, and never let the outside effect or diminish the inside. Don’t try and be or imitate someone else, be who you are and love it. One thing this video gets right: Know you’re gonna be ok no matter what. ‘Nough said, love to you all xxx",1
You reach true confidence by letting everything go.,1
"If you spend time getting to know yourself, and learn to love and accept that person then you strengthen the most important relationship of your life, the one you have with yourself. If that relationship is solid then you always have an inner safe haven no matter what is going on around you. That self love and understanding allows you to stay true to yourself in every situation, that is the deepest form of confidence.",1
"This is the most incredible,understandable video on confidence  I've came across by far , keep it up honestly .",1
This could not have come at a better time!! I'm literally building my first PC THIS WEEK!,1
"I've wanted to build a PC all my life but been too scared of breaking something to try. this week that ended with my first successful build, big thanks to this video!",1
I have been building custom computers for 25 years and I still found several things in this build guide that I did not know. Nice job LTT.,1
"I've also been building computers for about 20 years.  The main reason why these videos are the paramount of PC builders is because he and his friends are entertaining as well as informative. I am always learning.  To be a leader,  one needs a team and one person can't do it all.  Good jobs guys.",1
This is peak LTT. I can imagine how proud the team is putting this together!,1
"I've built plenty of PC's over the years, I'm not necessarily the target demogrpahic for this. But my goodness this is a fantastic video, I learned plenty in here despite my experience. Great job guys.",1
Ok wow! This was EXTREMELY helpful! I'm still just in the planning/saving up stage for building my own PC and this whole video was so insightful and made me excited to get started. Thanks guys!,1
"See, people appreciate the work that goes into creation of such high quality videos! That's what makes you guys stand out so much",1
"As someone with exactly zero experience with building computers, this was invaluable. I followed along step by step and actually built a working (budget) gaming rig! Thank you all so much for this video.",1
This is very valuable advice. It’s easy to overthink and completely lose track of your end goal. This can be detrimental to your future. Thanks Ali!,0
"Future wife?! We're going to have a ""how to have a productive bachelor party/wedding"" series soon 😁🎉So true that social threats get us all wound up. Viewing things as an experiment takes off a lot of pressure because you're focusing more on the process than the end result. I like that mental board of advisors thinking. Great video, Ali 🙂",1

I’ve been an overthinker my whole life too so it’s really cool to see someone I look up to discuss this and explain how to move through it. I’ve been talking myself through these moments of paralysis but these tips seem much more helpful so thank you! I’ll give them a try 🙏🏽,1

"Ann, I'm 47 and when I was little my mom would take me to the public library. There was a wonderful woman that would read stories to the children and give the adults time to find what they needed. She would read fantasy books with dragons and fairies, it was such an amazingly positive time in my life. You sound just like her and when you are making something or saving something you give me that same feeling of wonder and joy watching you work your ""magic""! This is one of the best channels on all of YouTube, thank you Ann for everything you do!",1
"This series gives me confidence that there's always a way for you to mess up and there's always a way for you to make it better. So, be hopeful everyone and Thank you Ann 😊",1
"One of my favorite cakes my mother ever made started out as a near fail. It was a cheesecake that had cracked down the middle. We had blueberries growing in our yard, so she took a bunch that we'd already picked, cooked them down into a thick jelly, and poured it into the crack. As I recall, she called it ""Grand Canyon Blueberry Cheesecake.""",1
"The pool cake was so cute! ""Put an appropriate toy depending on what character your child is currently obsessed with"", I'm 20 and I would still absolutely love to get a cake like that.",1
"As soon as hyper realistic cakes came up, my first thought was SideSerf! I love that you made sure to point out that she has problems with her videos being stolen and uncredited to spread the word to new audiences. It's why she uses the fluorescent green icing now. 

I love watching all your content but it just mesmerises me when you bake. <3",1
"just woke up at 6am, nothing like an upload from Ann to start off our Fridays! the effort you put into every single video you make is just *chef's kiss* easily the most informative and creative baking channel I know (and it goes so far beyond that as you've shown time and time again)",1
The transformation of these cakes are mind blowing!,1
"Ann, I'm so glad you stepped in to be the Aussie mum the world needed. Have you ever thought about doing an episode on traditional Australian bakes, like lamingtons, ANZAC Biscuits, pavlovas etc?. They're good recipes for new bakers. Also, maybe find an old CWA cookbook and follow the recipes, especially when Australia still had rations.",1
Imagine being Ann’s friend?!?!? That’s already a treat. I couldn’t imagine being sick and her being her amazing self by delivering a delicious cake to me🤍🤍🤍I hope your friend is feeling better.,1
I love the rescue videos especially because Ann tells us how to avoid the fail in the first place and then also shows us how to fix it <3,1
I wanna learn  more magic😀,1
Amazing!! I will surely try 10 of them,1
Mind blowing magician got talent!,1
Very Great Moves 👍,1

"**The movie explains how to kill him** You need to make him be afraid you. What ever he turns into, you need to face that fear and fight back. Once Pennywise realises that you aren't scared, he will begin to starve because he ""feeds"" off of fear. Once he starves, and is weakened, you can finish him off for good.",0
"Laughter defeats fear.
It would have made more sense in the remake if instead of bullying and insulting IT, they start laughing at how silly and not frightening the clown really is. Without any fear, IT gets weaker and weaker until it finally shrinks down to the bug it truly is.",0
So I'm watching this for nostalgia reasons. I still LOVE this series!,1
The reason why Pennywise said fear when he was defeated is not because he will spread more of it. It's because he is feeling fear. And he let go for 2 reasons. So he can go down to his lair and because he's in shock,0
"I'm not entirely sure of how I stumbled upon this channel, but as an avid hunter of movie/comic book lore, this channel is absolutely amazing. Kya is such a legend.

Great video. I wrote many down and will use them. Thanks very much.,1
"Housekeeper here! I really thought these were going to be ridiculous, but a lot of them are actually pretty good tips. Some of them are a little extra, like don’t go to the trouble of blending up dried grapefruit peel and mixing it with baking soda, just make a paste with baking soda, lemon juice, and white vinegar. Also I don’t think flying round while mopping the floors is a hack. Maybe just take off your shoes.",1
"Can someone tell me why they never list the quantities of the ingredients, or how long to let things sit for?",0

DDOI is such an educational channel - without him humans would never grow thumbs,1
"1.) Honey pot ants are also delicious... or so I'm told.
2.) The extraction of those cactus peppers is downright horrifying (in the trypophobic sense), yet I am still curious as to how they taste...",0
the way that kid toss the chalk away when he finished writing is golden. Also a dragon fruit is the fruit of a cactus plant. Prickly pear is also another delicious one.,1
The duck going for a swim and the service dog pushing the wheelchair are the cutest things I've seen all day,1
"for those wondering, the way how honey pot ants get their abdomens so big with fluids, it done by feeding a freshly emerged adult ant tons of food while their exoskeleton is still soft. this allows the gaster to stretch bigger than normal leading to how the ants become so plump. they do this because if a shortage of food comes, the other ants can get it from the ants that store it in their large abdomens called repletes. it really is fascinating thing to see happen.",1
"As the pinned comment already said, I think this was one of your coolest videos. It had a lot of weird but cool and fascinating clips! I really enjoy watching your content!",1
The fruit from the cactus is actually pretty decent! It’s been a few years since I’ve last tried it but sometimes it can be kinda tangy if I remember correctly.,1
DDOI never fails to impress me. Keep up the great work!,1
"In this day and age, my life has become complicated, especially my social and digital life. I always wondered how to simplify it somehow. Thank you for making this video!",1
"“Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations",1
"The biggest thing I've realized lately is that the more money you have, the more money you will want to spend.
So you never really feel like you have enough.
That's why I really like the idea mentioned in this video of learning how to be satisfied with what you already have.
This is especially true of us in the first world.
We get carried away by envy and comparison and believe the lie that other people live happier lives than us because they have all this stuff, that they are ""living the dream"".
But the fact is that the only reason they have all this stuff is because they are stressed out all the time trying to maintain their excessive lifestyles.
And if they stopped pushing to get more and more stuff then they would realize that happiness was already within their reach.

The irony is that people in the third world that come to live in the first world have a tendency to become like this the most.
They have lived their whole lives in poverty feeling envy for those in the first world who have everything they need.
So when they come to live here and get a job, they carry their envy with them and buy into the lie that they need more and more stuff.
Their family back home wonder why they are so stingy in sending money.
But the family doesn't realize that the ""cost of living is much higher"" where we live.

"Perfect Video as always EZ. In today's day & age, every person needs to remove excess baggage from one's life and embrace the idea of simplification. Both Sense and Simplicity are the two most significant aspects of our lives!",1
I just love how this video is an amalgamation of all the past videos you have produce so far. Thanks again for this wonderful food for the thought Eizelgänger 🖤,1
"Thank you, Einzelganger, for these mentally nutritious videos that you make for us to feed our minds.  Peace.",1
Good summary!  When I crave something I imagine as realistically as possible that I already have it.  This helps me know if I really want it.,1
"That last point is really true. It's not about simplifying all aspects of life just for its own sake. Rather, the point is for a more tranquil life. Thanks for the video.",1
"I love your channel. The technical details are perfect. 

I’m an engineer and I work with batteries as a hobby. There are two kinds of batteries that are LiON. One is “protected” and the other is “unprotected”. 

The protected ones prevent over-charging and over-discharging as well as over current. The unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection. Guess which people choose for their vaping. 

Lithium ion batteries have a huge energy density. They are damaged by over charging and over discharging. Cheap chargers don’t behave and will over charge. Few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge. 

So why don’t people use protected cells?  Generally those have too low current to make vaping possible. The current draw to instantly heat to 200C is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in, causing things to not work or work much more slowly.",1

"They removed the trust ""verification"" by removing the dislike number from being seen.
Yes, I get all the arguments of WHY they did it. but people can watch a video to see if the dislike ratio is justified and read the comments to why the dislike was made.
It's sort of like reading reviews on a product you are purchasing....",0
I remember when vaping was purely prescribed to recovering smokers. 10+ years ago my friend's mother had a vape that looked exactly like a cigarette and was recommended to her by a proffesional. Now I see middle schoolers sharing them in the parking lot of the school,0
"Making a separate comment for this: One thing you didn't mention in the exploding vape part of the video is *counterfeit batteries*. You mentioned faulty batteries, poorly designed vapes, but I think this is a big one that should not be left out. Most people who vape seek out batteries from known reputable brands, however there's a huge problem of cheap, counterfeit imitations of those batteries being sold under the original brand name *even on places like Amazon*. Amazon have a huge problem with counterfeit products being sold through their website and it has really tarnished their brand in many people's eyes",0
"A shame how quickly vapes went from a ""better alternative to cigarettes"" to ""public heath hazard and under scrutiny""",0

"It looks weird to me to have the whites be so smooth and perfect.  This method seems to preserve the whites the best, although it requires more water and vinegar than other techniques.  I've been using Alton Brown's technique, and it works better than the classic vortex method, but this one looks even easier.",1
Ooh out-sciencing Heston! Can't wait to give this a go for lunch tomorrow. I really like the concept and how practical it is for preparing large numbers of eggs.,1
"Great tip! I've added vinager to the poaching water,  and when doing multiple eggs used rings to hold the individual eggs in place which can shape them kind of ugly (into rounds) compared to yours. I've used small tuna tins that I cut the top and bottom off of for this. 
Pre soaking in vinager is much smarter too!",1
I already am comfortable poaching an egg. I even own egg laying chickens. But I am so happy and excited to try this method! You are absolutely  right I have seen tons of poaching videos and this is a unique technique.,1
So wonderful! Can't wait to try some perfect poached eggs soon 😁,1
"I'll remember this for the next time I host brunch for a large group!  There are tons of great tips in here to help get a lot of eggs on the table at the same time.   If you're only making three or four eggs, this method seems like overkill.  I add a few tablespoons of vinegar to the simmering water and crack one egg at a time into a ramekin so that I can very gently add it to the water.  As long as the eggs are fresh, it works every time.",1
Incredible method!! After 10 years as a chef I thought I tried every way possible to poach eggs and this one is by far the best !! Tried it this morning it works flawlessly 10/10 thanks for this tip 🔥🔥🔥,1
Seriously most useful video I've watched in a long time,1
"I can confidently poach one egg at a time using the vortex method, but this is blowing my mind for poaching multiple eggs at once!",0
I learned this very trick from a fantastic French chef early on in my cooking career and it is a game changer for poached eggs,1
"If 'Building a Second Brain' sounds interesting to you and you'd like to know more, you can buy Tiago's book on Amazon here: https://geni.us/5NI78lZ 🚀 (Or take it further and join Tiago's Building a Second Brain Course - https://go.aliabdaal.com/BASB )",1
This is one of the very best recaps of the Building a Second Brain method Ali. Fantastic job to you and your team 🙌 It was so much fun collaborating together and I hope we do it again!,1
"SUMMARY NOTES:
00:00 Intro
-The problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information.

-The ""second brain"" system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information.

-The ""second brain"" system has helped Ali in his own life, and can hopefully help others as well.

-The ""second brain"" system uses CODE as an acronym to explain its core foundations - Capture, Organize, Distill, Express.

00:41 What is a Second Brain and why should you have one?
- A second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas.

- Building a second brain can help you express your creativity, be more productive and make better decisions. 

- Every job today involves knowledge work of some kind, and a second brain can help you with inputting, processing, and outputting information.

- The methodology for building a second brain has four parts: Capture, Organize, Distill and Express (CODE).

04:56 C (Capture)
- Ali discusses different ways of capturing information, both manually and automatically.

-Ali captures his thoughts and ideas in Apple Notes.

- He also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.

- Having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything.

- Ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day, as well as highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.

08:32 O (Organise)
- Ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in one's learning.

- This means that when you come across something relevant, you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take, rather than creating a new category for it.

- You can still search for specific information using control F or command F if needed.

- This system is especially helpful when working on long-term projects with many moving parts.

11:07 D (Distill)
- Ali talks about a method called progressive summarization, which is basically like highlighting, but on steroids.

- This is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.

- Different than highlighting we're used to in school - it's not particularly effective for  retention in your own personal brain, but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.

11:45 E (Express)
-The ""E"" in the second brain system stands for Express, meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas, you need to share them with the world in some way.

-Sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback, collaborate with others, and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work.

-Without expressing our ideas, they are essentially useless - it's important to find a way to share your creativity with others.

13:09 How my Second Brain has helped Ali
-The course/book has helped Ali become more productive, but also more creative and less stressed in general.

-The system taught Ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts - working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one, most of the work is already done. 

-The system has also helped with his teaching work - he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information.",1
I am eagerly waiting for Ali's first TED Talk. It would be amazing...! I wonder what topic he will speak on.,1
Having a second brain is no joke. I am currently using notion to perfect this. Great video Ali. Definetly devouring all of the information you are putting out! 🔥📓🤔,1
Now this is my favourite video! I have been struggling a lot when it comes to handling multiple projects.  Thanks Ali!! You really answered a lot of my questions today!!,1
"I'm so happy about this book. I'm reading it right now. Am on page 90, and it's already changing my digital life. Thank you, Tiago Forte 🙏🏾♥️",1
"Thanks for this Ali and Team! It really helps break down the process of thinking to have a 2nd brain. I've been calmer with my projects since listening to you and I grow ever more productive with my schedule and life in general.

As for the video idea, perhaps you can make a video on how to deal with burn outs? I believe burnouts burn creativity. You want to push, but you just mentally can't. I've dealt with it in the past, but Im getting out of it now since the company I want to work for actually hit me up to work with them. It gave me a boost!",1
"Your Book Club series is one of the most useful series on YouTube. I have a commonplace book in Evernote and I'm always amazed at the gems I've come across over the years. You spinning around by a hot tub when you were talking about self-care is such a vibe 😁Love the idea of organising ideas according to actionability. Felt called out by ""hoarding your ideas"" 😃😭Thank you for this breakdown of the book, Ali. Noted as a must read and I also need to work ""expressing"" my finds.",1
"There's a game where you can roleplay as the monsters the game is called ""accurate rainbow friends roleplay"" have fun playing it",1
"Personally, I would just play accurate rainbow friends roleplay instead of spending 50 robux in it in a other game , plus in accurate rainbow friends Rp it actually gives you the real mao and all the details.",1
Congratulations to everybody who is early and found this comment,1
"hear me go on a rant,


nic, these are literally friday night funkin morphs, not the actual rainbow friends morphs. thats why there's a sing option, because friday night funkin is a rhythm game, its a really cool game, you should check it out sometime.",1

"Sometimes when you are in a dark place, you think that you are buried but you have actually been planted. If you are going through that hard time, just know that I am cheering for you..",1
"To absorb what one reads, it's crucial to master concentration. When I started reading in my early youth, my mind would wander before finishing a page. Over time, my concentration improved to a point where I could read dozens of pages without losing my train of thought. Activities like chess, reading and meditation are effective in improving concentration. I know a Buddhist monk who can clear his mind for long periods even when in a noisy environment. It's a skill that he developed over time with practice and discipline. It's literally rewired his brain. Schools fail miserably in teaching our youth in the art of self learning.",1
I was born into a relatively poor family.  Never had the opportunity to go to college.  I became obsessed with the self learning technique right out of high school.  I happened to live in a town that had one of the top 10 business schools in the US.  I would go to the University library and pour over the text books in the order they were taught.  within 18 months I had the knowledge of an MBA.  By the time I was 20 I started my own company and was a millionaire before I turned 40.  It took so long because when a guy with no formal education walks into a bank for a loan they tend to want to laugh at you.  I finally found a banker that would talk to me.  I explained my business model and told him how the current inverted yield curve would effect the time value of the money I would borrow he was floored.,1
Be a teacher but forever a student. Listening in itself is a lost art. So difficult to run across a good listener. Joe Rogan comes to mind. I really enjoy the interviews he has conducted with Elon as his guest. I don't necessarily agree with Elon on many things but he seems sincere and takes his time trying to explain his thoughts. What I like about Joe is he gives his guest's time to speak without interrupting them with his own beliefs ( or agenda like so many on the tell a vision).  Being a good listener takes practice but well worth the effort.,1
"The most important thing for learning, like Musk says, is understanding the fundamentals of whatever it is you want to understand. Always, always, always build a solid foundation and then everything else will make perfect sense.",1
I love Elon! He makes it cool to be smart! He's a genius.😊👏👏👏👏,1
"The saying goes “ A jack of all trades is a master of none- but still always better than a master of one” so arguably Elon is a good example, rather than proving it wrong",1
"As an undergrad, I had to take history, and I'm an math/science person who hates history. On my own, I learned to rearrange stories in my head to make it make sense to me. I would exchange real people with people I knew to relate to the topics. I scores a hundred on about every exam when most were struggling. The nstructor made a comment that it was one person who always scored a hundred. They were like who who because there's no way. His tests were long. When I told them what I was doing to remember the content, they laughed, but I was like it works. And believe it or not, I still remember most of it and that was 22 years ago.",0
"Hi everyone! As a few of you have pointed out, the map at 9:36 incorrectly shows Taiwan as a part of China. Sorry for the error!",0
"The loss of knowledge is an issue that preoccupies me. It's very common to this day, even in regular companies. There are times when something breaks and no one knows how to fix it, because the last guy who knew about it left the company ten years ago.",0
"As someone who was born in Dhaka and learned about Dhaka Muslin as a kid, seeing the fabric being covered here was a treat to remember. Thanks for shining light on it",1
I was born in Dhaka and have never even heard of this Muslin. It makes me really sad to think how much of our culture and knowledge was destroyed.,0
"Ah colonialism: Destroy a cotton crop species that is highly valued, replace it with a poor, low-value alternative, eventually re-create the plant, and hold market monopoly for expensive product. Great job!",0
My grandmother had a sari made of Dhaka Muslin. I remember as a kid hugging her and remember how soft it was. I miss her so much.,1
"I think one of the greatest losses to history is that most people think ""Egypt and China are very far"" from each other.
Yes they are quite distant and it would take an individual months to do it. But it wasn't an individual it was a series of people(s).
Just because they didn't have planes or the combustion engine doesn't mean people weren't crossing continents.
Not a person or persons but people.

 Bolivia is the poorest country in all of south america, rural people, especially indigenous people living in the Altiplano literally dont have enough money to live a propper life. The quinoa boom meant that thousands of families could aford education, bettering its living standars and getting out of poverty. 
Its really easy to talk about how unsustainable their practices where when your country got rich trough just as unsustainable practices plus the exploitation of millions of human beings...",0

It’s funny bc I went to high school with Mikael we were both in the same grade but he’s actually the most successful kid that I know that came from our graduation class,1
Smart kid. Not many figure out the art of business rite off the rip this kid will be successful,1
He's spot on with that maintenance number of 20%. I've owned my trucking company 4 years now and that figure has always worked. Someone taught this young man well. He's wayyyyy ahead of the learning curve of this industry.,1
"First off, I would like to congratulate you and the entire team on making it up to 500k subscribers. That is a huge, huge achievement. There is still a long way to go. I subbed to this amazing channel back when it had just 60k subs. I have been here since almost a year now. Time flies by for sure. 
I don't have a lot to say about this video since it's pretty technical. I'm not really a huge fan of trucks. I will say, however, that I want you guys to get back to this guy and see how he's doing in a couple years. This guy definitely thinks big and I love that. He is such a huge inspiration. I have started my affiliate marketing and already made $7k in just 6 months. It's nothing compared to the amount of money he makes, but we will get there for sure. 
Kudos to you guys again. You are doing such an amazing job. Can you please make the vending machine video (I believe you made one) go live? I would love that. Thanks.
Also, what happened to the Q&A bliz? You didn't do it this time. Why? I was interested in knowing what books he reads, if any. 
Looking forward to a next video of yours ;). When is it coming? 
I noticed the last video was deleted, which is kind of a bummer since I didn't get to watch it all in time.",1
"He is 19 guys seriously instead of making positive comments you talk about how much he makes
It’s not all about money in this life
The kid is a good example for many of us out here",1
"Amazing interview, startling how much he has done at such a young age! Good lessons on the virtues of hard work, and resourcefulness. Must have had terrific parents at home to encourage and guide his endeavors.",1
"I’ve never seen a speech that motivates me more. Business is about learning, not taking stupid risks that aren’t calculated. What an incredible talk.",1
Your businesses will make you rich but your investments will make you wealthy. The future is inevitable. I pray everyone here becomes extremely successful.,1
"Greatest point for me was, "" work like everyone's trying to take it away from you."" 
Almost every industry I've been in I trusted too much and right others, including my managers and they took my knowledge and passed it as if it was there's. They took it from me. I don't trust like that anymore and I don't teach everything I know anymore because of that. Knowledge is power.",0
"i’m late 17 and my business started really randomly and unexpectedly lol, I wanted to buy some leather goods but the prices killed me so i was like “ya know what im cheap im gonna make my own stuff” and spent tons of time on youtube and google learning and messing up and leaning new things from the ways i messed up, then my family was impressed by the finished result which surprised me and they told me i should start a business so i was like welp why not give it a shot, and i’ve only very recently started but so far Alhamdulillah i’ve been blessed and it’s going better than id imagined the beginning would go; 

moral of the story is be cheap, learn a skill from that cheapness and capitalize on that, in my first week i made more than in a month at previous jobs i’ve had throughout high school and i’ve actually been able to enjoy it, learn things while making
money, and look at all of my work and feel fulfilled and happy unlike any of my other jobs",1
"Love that he mentioned the willingness to learn, to keep learning, and the value of education when it comes to the language of business.",1
"If you decided to become an entrepreneur, & nothing will convince you other wise till you succeed... You’re definitely an entrepreneur!!!!",1
"Working in the restaurant industry, I cannot believe how many people think simply owning a restaurant means you ""sit back and let the money roll in.""",0
"Feeling reassured after watching this. I am a late entrepreneur, 48 years old. Had been working in the same industry as my current business for past 20 years. Made enough money 😊. Now in my own company i am doing A to Z, right from making sales calls  to project management. One day i will make my mark like Mr. Mark.",1
I watched my father start and run his business. It’s incredibly hard. Long hours lots of sacrifice. Requires risk tolerance but also you must be mentally tough to get through all the obstacles. Most people cannot handle the level of stress that comes along with it,0
People fail because of lack of effort or lack of patience. There is much more than that and now when I'm doing videos on youtube I totally understand why people quit. It's really challenging and sometimes you have no motivation to continue. Anyway great video! :),0
They shouldn't have permanently banned so many real accounts.,0

Thank you Brian Tracy 🙏🏽,1
"Great video.  But let me talk about something important, I see many young and old make mistakes that I think should not be.  I believe that everyone, young or old, should have an investment plan that increases their financial returns from three figures to six figures.  The investment can be your retirement plan or future plan, depending on what you want, but what matters most is that you have an investment that is profitable.",1
Great video! Thank you to sharing with us. Wish you good luck and success!,1
Wow! That was pretty brilliant information. Also the way you deliver is simply awesome. Thanks a lot for sharing,1
"Ive been a painting contractor for 35 years, just me and my brother, except for the first few years when the winter was a little tricky we've been super busy the whole time. All residential, we have a van , a paint sprayer and a powerwasher  and a bunch of ladders and basic other supplies.  Get good at something nobody wants or has time to do and you'll always be busy. You must do excellent work as well. All our customers are our sales agents. It has a low overhead. You can expand if you want  with employees but that does make it a bit more complicated",1
"Sir, had you mentioned the profitability in each of these business along with the headaches of maintenance like maximum in dump trucks, additional knowledge required, employees required etc your video would have been excellent. By the way, real estate rental business is the best with adding appreciation. Good luck.",1
"There is always a risk associated with starting a business - I agree with this! That's the reality, not all of the businesses are most likely to succeed, but it is always up to us whether to persevere for another day or to just give up. It is important to build a business you are passionate and compassionate to continue every day. Don't forget to invest in your knowledge and your business' improvement, rather than on growing profits alone.",1
"Awesome video - thanks for the great information.  I own rentals too and love it..   It takes some time to figure things out, but that's true of anything.  Keep up the great work and look forward to more videos!",1
"Well explained sir 🙏I am very excited about the prospect of using cryptocurrency, not just as a money equivalent, but using it as a way to earn something as a result of doing some type of work.",1
"Where I live I have NEVER seen a betting shop close down - one round the corner from me has been open for over 50 years. There's a constant stream of customers going into these places and even with internet competition they still seem to thrive. Betting shops is where I would strongly consider investing it. Cigarettes is another one, BAT share price just goes up and up. Warren Buffet loves the tobacco industry and who can blame him with those huge profits. Even with all the bad write up about the dangers of smoking people still do it as it's so highly addictive. Two businesses that just don't fail - betting shops and cigarettes, they even have a strong link !",1
"Love the breakdown. I've gradually built my finance and made my first $100k through investing which i've used to start my jewellery business, and with what I’ve learned over a decade investing, given enough time, solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount, but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out. So the onus is on newbies to beware. Having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out.",1
Well explained I appreciate 🙌 I can't wait to get started because people are really making a lot of money from it nowadays,1

It is absolutely brilliant. A fantastic ""ad"" if you will. Which shows how great of a marketer you truly are. Genius.",1
The recent content feels better than ever before and the frequency of uploads is just perfect. Can see how much work is being put into this,1
"The video is great especially when you talk about the Agency business model!

Although I disagree about some other business models generalizations. For example, on affiliate marketing nobody says you get paid once, it's an option, there's revenue sharing, pay per sale etc.

From dropshipping you can also get recurring with monthly kits or other types of products that have a smaller life cycle (costumer).
The margins game is highly variable and that's where some people get ahead of others.

Nevertheless, selling ROI Services for businesses is still great for beginners but in the future it would be wise to get traffic in other ways while also building a brand for your agency... Website, content and all.",1
Love the content and urge of openning people's eyes  to see where the future is heading to ! Great work G !,1
"Thank you Iman for this awesome video, you explain everything so clear! I will analyze everything and watch more of your videos to try and start on my own, and hopefully one day buy your course, appreciate it man <3",1

I love how Ethan just gets shit on at his own highlights channel,0
Ethan said this is the last video on Tate... 5 videos ago. Dude can't stop talking about him. You can tell what Tate said about him scarred him and he's been traumatized by it is and this is his way of letting out his trauma,0
Ethan has had the biggest fall I’ve seen in recent years. Such a shame the dude just sits on his ass all days and hates on other people,0

"Isn't it just glorified fashion illustration? Essentially these are 3D drawings that's it :) Actual fashion and the beauty of it is conquering your fashion sketches, conquering your elaborate ideas by overcoming physical obstacles. That is one of the main reason we love fashion. To draw an haute couture dress is somewhat easy, but to make it, is beyond hard. Making a dress is a journey for all the people involved, that is how innovation happens. These animated pieces remind me the 80s licensing craze or something of sort :) It is a great new avenue for fashion houses to bank easy money. It is not the future of fashion, it is just a new market for fashion to expand. Silly gimmicks bringing big buck, that's about it :)",1

"For sure the reality business is hard and painful and takes a huge amount of effort if you want to build something great. The best quote I heard was ""Nobody is expecting you to do something amazing, but it is amazing when you do something"".  The reality is you might not build a multi billion dollar business that is global, but you might build something that brings value, and that is why we get into business to test ourselves our own ability and to be different.  You can only admire what Elon Musk has achieved and the potential of where technology could take us in the future.",1
I already lost a lot of money recently trying to pursuit my dreams. It's frustrating and depressing. But Elon definitely gives me hope and determination. He is a role model for me.,1

""Entrepreneurs are born of everyday"".

"i was losing my confidence in thinking my dream of opening up a local coffee shop would be impossible, but this story was so inspiring. Mooney is so damn down to earth its really cool to see the success of just the love and passion into it.",1
Wow amazing. Maxwell just gave away the secret to running a successful business. I own and operate my own company and 95% of what he said is something you cant learn from school. Honestly well done,1

"I LOVE THIS INTERVIEW!!

I've been dreaming of opening a coffee shop in my neighborhood over the last 2 years. We moved to a brand new neighborhood without much comercial options within 4 miles. I keep telling people I know I dream of this and the associate pastor at my church said I should pitch them putting up a pop up stand in the church. I was amazed that they trust me enough to do that but at the same time I'm scared to start even though I have a lot of support at church and friends. 

One of my friends owns a coffee shop already on the other side of town and is willing to get me in front of the right people. But again, my family is relying on my income to live. I know it would be great! I just need to find a person I trust to help run it along side with me so I can maintain my insurance career at the same time since it's not demanding at all.",1

"As you can see we are already in August and I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naïve, the sphere have seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I'd say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9.2 BTC when I started at 3.5 BTC  in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from LIBERTON CORP would advise y’all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you aren't sure about.",1
"keep <,up the great work. You are truly an asset to the community. Thanks, for all you do! I like your truthful coverage. BTC's price has been fluctuating lately, buying isn't a tough call, but it is a very tough call to figure out what to do aside holding. The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades, while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable. Most people do not understand how the space works. Your advantage in understanding chart won't guarantee what an asset is going to do. Prices will go up or down. Nevertheless, the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down. I've always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader, LIBERTONCORP . I made 12BTC from this recent crash and despite the ups and down in the market I’m still bagging more money",1
"Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 3.5 BTC from day trad!ng with Liberton Corp insights and charts. His been one step ahead of other analysis..Stick with BTC/ETH/BNB/ADA/MATIC...",0

"High fashion is sometimes very abstract, very elitist, very bizarre and sometimes purely ridiculous. But if you push all of the crazy price tags aside and all the ridiculous celebrity endorsers too, you find artisans, people who study and excel in a craft. They deserve to be highlighted more. Behind that overpriced Chanel bag is a leather/chain/fabric artisan and years of creative thought and passion. Fast fashion is slowly killing our planet (water consumption, landfills, toxic chemical dumped in village waters, people paid pennies etc), haute couture is rare, it’s scarce. I find the luxury scene beyond ridiculous but I love my high end pieces, that have lasted me years and will continue to do so. Behind these fashion shows are artisans, that will always be better than any fast producing machine.",0
Imran interviews the most powerful individuals in the fashion industry; but I truly believe he holds just as much influence. This series is exactly what the industry needs in terms of consumers listening and fellow designers/industry professionals taking note. Imran is the projector of those poignant words and as a collective it holds much greater power.,1
"Luxury fashion is one of the world's biggest industries. I think this is a great topic for a Bloomberg series. I would be interested is seeing more of this type of content. I am particularly interested in the recent collaboration between Gucci and Balenciaga, especially now that I know they both come under the Kering umbrella. Other recent collaborations include Versace and Fendi, which could be the subject of another video. The more recent video in this series examines the Chinese market, and how fashion brands are now targeting young Asian consumers.",1
The worst thing to happen to fashion was ‘influencers’ who encourage always wanting the next instead of appreciating the now and the classic. They’re so fickle and encourage everyone else to be the same.,0
"I love how “luxury” is about preserving the craft and labor of the poor for the rich. Like what really is the point here? Is it the small artisans who get $$ and praise or the fashion “houses” and companies that actually get to design,  exploit labor, and sell for profit? 🥱 The definition just isn’t strong enough for me to care.",0
"I used to love high fashion, but the more I learn about what goes on in the industry the more I feel like pursuing a different career choice, so much nepotism, elitism, and lack of creativity. it’s almost as if you don’t fit within certain enclaves, you’re not welcomed.",0
"I love the new sustainability efforts, excited to see new changes!",1
What annoys me the most is that these so called a majority of these high class fashion brands exploit their workers with long hours and little pay even though they are selling products for an extremely high price tag.,0
"I switched years ago from fashion to reupholstery. So glad I get to reduce, reuse, upcycle. Last of a dying breed. 2% of the world do what we still do.",1
As a fellow Asian I can confidently say that the rarest thing in this video was Kyle's beautiful stache.,1
Back in 2017 I caught a 40-pound king upriver along the Klutina River (feeder river to the Copper River) and it was one of the best days of my life. That was a ‘reel’ workout!,1
I always enjoyed selling this product as a fishmonger. It was something my guest looked forward to and I was happy to sell. It rly is top tier fish and some I do quite respect,1
So glad Kyle brought up how important salmon are for Native Alaskan communities!,1
Wish Kyle and his crew all the luck to always bring home king salmon every time they go out to fish for it,1
"I was lucky to have Copper River Salmon once, it was by far the best salmon I’ve ever tasted.",1
I'm really glad he acknowledged the indigenous traditions and food culture.  There are a lot of fishermen that don't care about preservation or morals.,1
"It's fascinating that a gill netted fish in an estuary (not at the peak of their growth cycle) garners so much money when compared to troll caught kings on hook and line (when theyre still putting on fat) that are treated immediately to ike jima, processed individually and then hand packed on ice to get core temps down immediately.",1

"Hamza, I just wanted to say thank you, brother. I know this will probably be lost in the comments but from the bottom of my heart, you have given me the tools and strategies to save myself from taking my own life. 6 months ago I was in a very dark place and had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and had no will to live. I randomly stumbled upon your channel and have applied all of the tools, strategies and philosophies you teach since then. I truly would not be here without you, and I am so grateful for you. I now have a purpose and direction in my life, outside of the YouTube videos I watch like yours that have high ROI on my time, I am off social media completely. I'm 17 years old and I'm still at the very beginning of my manhood but to anyone reading this, it gets better. Happiness, peace and prosperity take time, hard work and a lot of effort. But it is so worth it. I am now leading those around me to this way of life and building up my brothers and community. I just today did my first cold approach and it went well. If anyone is struggling with mental health issues or feeling purposeless in life, put in more effort and combat life itself in every way you can, things will get better for you if you choose the difficult path that builds strong men.",1
"Thanks for having me on the stream Hamza, I wish I said more and I wish I was more clear with my words... but I was nervous. Anyways I rewatched the chat and had a good laugh, saw a lot of toxicity and criticism but all is welcome, the chat was really funny and any criticism I got I deserved. Thanks again Hamza, this was an awesome opportunity to talk to you even if we didn’t talk mainly about the subject we were supposed to. Enjoy life.",1
These 3 men are on the right path.,1
"Thanks again for your time Hamza. I still can't remember how I stumbled on your channel, but you've given me good info that keeps me on the right path, and you've helped me value my masculinity for the first time in years. I'll be sure to let you know if there's any updates on my situation!",1
"1:17:06 huge W for admiting that, it takes a lot of courage, idk If you will read this but If you do I want you to know that I respect you a lot",1
"What Hamza said about being careful about momentous emotional self improvement decisions driven by motivation really hits home for me. 
Fallen off the wagon on no fap, drinking, diets etc because of it in the not too distant past. 
Invaluable advice for a young man.",1
"Hamza is a man of legacy,may Allah bless your work and soul and guide all of us to the right path 👏👏👏🙏🙏",1
"I just wanted to say thank you, Hamza. You provide me and so many other guys with the kind of wisdom it would takes years of mistakes to eventually gain. Hope everyone who reads this keeps growing and progressing 🙏🏾",1
These new streams are definitely a great addition to the arsenal of the Hamza content.,1
Well done hamza you helped a lot of guys respect,1

"Despite the economic downturn, I'm having the best time of my life financially. Earning over $83k in the last 2months with an investment of $19,000. Money can be made even in a bear market. Make the most of it.",1
"My concern is that with the big players waking up to this business model, they will muscle in easily and squeeze out these little guys, who was doing well, below the radar. Now that the cat is out of the bag, their profitability will experience more headwinds going forward.",0
Nothing brings me more satisfaction than efficiency. To think about how all that merchandise is going to be re-sold and not go into a landfill makes me very happy indeed.,1
"I remember watching a documentary about how the area of West Africa had become a dumping ground for used/unwanted clothes from Europe and the Americas; more specifically the North Americas. I was totally shocked and had no idea about this. Villagers would sometimes travel for several miles on foot, sometimes with their kids, to pick through this clothing waste to sell into their communities and earn money. Most of it just became literal mountains of clothes on the beaches and wherever.",0
"I have yet to make a return to Amazon that wasn’t  damaged, double shipped, or not as described. They could avoid a lot of returns by better vetting.
I also often select returned items if the saving are worth it, so far no problems.",1
This is one of the coolest things I've noticed recently. When Ollie's popped up in my hometown selling name-brand goods at a quarter of the original price...I knew liquidation stores would be the way of the future. I love it. It makes me happy seeing these goods find homes instead of ending up as pollution.,1
"As a person who shops on the clearance aisles at stores, I'm loving this documentary. It's an industry not many people think of on a large scale but definitely very profitable.",1
The only issue is that the majority of customers are re-sellers. So most consumers aren’t getting the discount. But either way it helps the environment which is great.,1

I loved this! The flow of Lakeyah is satisfying 💓,1
Latto and Lakeyah have such complimentary flows and deliveries. They are both great in their own ways too but hearing them work together is always a treat. I think the fanbases are generally really similar too which is nice to see likeminded people collide every time they collab. I hope someday I can gather even a tenth of the amount of fans with the perspectives that theses two fan bases have for my own music. Truly unmatched energy🔥,1
Respect to Lakeyah FR she is truly FLOURISHING !!! And Big Latto killed her verse per usual  <3,1
"The first thing I want you to know,whom ever you might be, is that God loves you.  I don't care what you have done in the past.  I don't care of the mistakes you have made.   The blunders we all have.  He loves you, I want you to understand that.  Millions have prayed this prayer around the world and now it is your turn.  In just a few moments time, if you believe it, is all God requires, believe it.  Forget about your past.  When they put Jesus in that tomb, they put all of your sins in that tomb as well.  When Jesus walked out of that tomb, He walked out victorious and we came out with Him a new creation in Christ Jesus.
I am going to pray, and I want you to pray with me.  I am going to say the words that you need to say.  Saying words cannot save you, but if you truly believe in your heart, you will be saved. And I want you to say them out loud and mean them with all of your heart.  And Jesus Christ will come into your heart and change your heart and change your life.  
Let us pray.

Dear God in Heaven.
I come to you.
I am sorry for my sins and the way I have lived.
The things I have done.
Please forgive me.
Cleanse me.
With your precious blood.
From every sin, I have ever committed.
Right now, with my mouth, I confess, the Lord Jesus.
And in my heart, I believe that Jesus died for me and rose from the dead.
And I accept Jesus Christ, this very moment, as my savior, my redeemer, and I make Him the Lord of my life.
And right now, I am a new creation, I am washed, I am cleansed, I AM SAVED.  
We ask this all in the name of Jesus. Amen.",1

"This is an amazing story, Most times, it amazes me greatly how I moved from an average lifestyle to earning over $63k per month. Utter shock is the word. I have understood a lot in the past few years to doubt that opportunities are bound in the financial markets. The only thing is to know where to focus.",1
I think this is very inspiring! And a big shoutout to anyone who is brave enough to follow their dreams and pursue a career or lifestyle that isn't ''the norm'' 😊,1
"When can CBNC actually show someone who created something cool (like a product turned business, an interesting YT channel, maybe they publish their own books, etc.) rather than these woefully unqualified finance “gurus” who add more detriment than value to most of its customers",0

Investing is so important in Life! SO IMPORTANT! I can't explain enough the importance of starting early and keeping the course. Love the video and I hope you make more video's on investing in the future!,1
"Building wealth involves developing good habits like regularly putting money away in intervals for solid investments. Financial management is a crucial topic that most tend to shy away from, and ends up haunting them in the near future. Putting our time and effort in activities and investments that will yield a profitable return in the future is what we should be aiming for. Success depends on the actions or steps you take to achieve it. ""You're not going to remember those expensive shoes you bought ten years ago, but you will remember every single morning when you look at your bank account that extra 0 in there. I promise, that's going to be way more fun to look at everyday"", I pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life",1

It’s so inspiring to new entrepreneurs to see others also starting their own businesses. Good luck to anyone who’s opening their first business!,1
"The detail and thoughtfulness some of these people put into their packaging is just insane. Obviously, whether the product itself is actually good is another matter, but just the sheer creativity, beauty and detail in the presentation would probably make me wanna order from them again even if the product itself wasn't anything super special. That kind of packaging makes receiving the product an ~experience~, like getting an incredible, delightful present. I would be smiling like crazy and squealing with delight as soon as I open a box like that, would probably make my whole week. These people are so cool and I admire and respect them so much",1
Just gonna add some positivity in the comment section by saying I’m so proud of of these people with their small business. Im personally too afraid to start my own business (not yet at least) but these people just straight up sent it with whatever they got lol. I genuinely wish all of them to do well 💕🙏,1
"I’m 12 as well and i was inspired to start my own business by these tiktoks, I started painting custom ordered seashells :) I’m so happy with how my business turned out :D all I did to figure out what I was going to sell is I went around my room five times with my eyes closed and what ever my finger landed on I sold and it landed on a seashell and that’s how my business started, I would really recommend starting your own business as a past time! :) it’s also a great way to earn money and allowance as a kid and it’s so fun to do I really enjoy it it can be stressful at times but it’s so worth it :D",1
I feel like small business owners like put their heart and soul into their packages and try to get it shipped in time but they still don't get appreciated for their hard work,0
The package look more expensive than the actual product,0
Extremely helpful!  Great overall video thank you.  I even love how your matched with some of the colors on the slide.  Very co-ordinated.  Just subscribed and will probably be binge watching your videos for the rest of the day.  I know the effort that it takes to produce these tutorials so much appreciated.,1
"I'm overwhelmed when trying to learn how to use Canva by myself, because there're tons of functions. Thank you for making this video.  Using Canva is much easỉer now!",1
"Wow. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Just finished your tutorial, it took me somewhere between three and four hours to go through it because I stopped it all the time to try out almost everything you had just presented, in order to remember things better, and while doing so actually discovered a few more things. I also appreciated some of your design ideas which further opened my eyes to the endless possibilities Canva offers. I had already watched a number of other tutorials, some also very well presented, but most are way too short: they just awaken your curiosity but then leave you hanging there, struggling. After having worked through your tutorial, I feel that I hit the ground running, and am now off to your other tutorials to learn more. Having come down with Covid - fortunately not too bad - I still have a few more days of quarantene left that I will use for studying and practising more! 😁",1
"This is a great video. Great tips like the ALT, shortcuts, etc besides all the clear explanations for each feature. Love the updated thread as well. Keep up the good work. Thanks for filling the 1.5 hours with very useful information delivering with such speed as well is commendable. Fantastic effort! Kudos to you.",1
"Wow. It’s like I’m actually in a class. Very informative, and presented at a digestible pace. Thank you so much. Worth watching multiple times so everything sinks in.",1

Unknowingly  you've helped me create my first piece.  A very special memorial card for my mumma. 😪

Again Thank you lovely Lady 💛",1

Can we all just give this man a round of applause for putting this information out here for FREE! Great video man!! Thank you so much for this course!!!🙌🏼👏🏼 I will study it all.,1
"By far the best Excel tutorial I have seen for beginners. Complete, basic, to the point and very useful in real life situations. Great course! Thank you, Shad Sluiter, for sharing!",1
Your explanations are simple and fluid. You have deconstructed all the difficulty myths related to learning Excel. Hats off and thank you!,1
"Thank you so much for this! I had an easy time following the pace of the course. Also, the examples and exercises were great! With 30-60 minutes per day, I could complete the course in 5 days. Good Stuff!",1
"Most logical and very easy-to-understand course content. His way of explaining is incomparable to anyone in his profession, and the topic is covered vividly and never feels bored. I gained so strong knowledge immensely in a tiny time. Hat off to the professor. You're the great teacher to me I ever had in this field, sir. Best wishes for your future tutorials and life as well.",1
"Excellent practical course for someone who knows only the very minimal basics, if that. Well modulated and articulated.  Designed for adult self learners. Easy to follow and it is a  plus that you did not use ""techie' language.  Your presentation style made it easy to follow without distractions. Real life examples are a plus.  Application of knowledge always enhances learning. Looking forward to your next course.",1
"I'm about 30 minutes in and I gotta admit, you are brilliant at organizing what you want to teach. You've managed to organize even zooming in and out at specific intervals to teach all those small aspects of the program. Really cool! I never knew excel was so intuitive either.",1
"This was an excellent class, well done in organization, methods and process.  There are lots of tools out there but this class is better because problems are solved as examples are worked out.  In this way it keeps your attention while deepening the learning.",1
"One hour into this video, and I have learned more about how to use APIs and Postman than I have with tons of other videos -- COMBINED! I can't see how video instruction can get better than this. All the money I have spent to learn this and actually understand it, and this video instructor provides the most precise explanation I have seen to date! EXCELLENT WORK!",1
There is so much thought process and hard work put in by the content creators! We need this kind of content more so that students feel more confident learning newer things! I have become a huge fan of the channel...hats off to you guys! Keep doing this great work!,1
"Here I am, employed as a developer, watching a video that purports to be for beginners, and it's a great video so far. One of the things I love about approaches like this is that, especially for developers like me who just picked up some crap over time and am doing stuff with it, there are lots of fundamentals that slip through those autodidactic cracks. For instance, I _know_ what ""statelessness"" means generally, but then at around 23:30 Craig explains not only clearly but completely enough for the context--with no extraneous details.

Nice work.",1
You guys make learning fun! The fact that you went over APIs in a broad sense and not just web-based really nailed home what an API really is. Wow!,1
"I'm enjoying your tutorial a lot, but a side note: I think its recommended to invoke pip as python -m pip because it is more portable. Having recently had issues due to Windows10 and trying, naively, to just invoke pip on its own I thought it would be worth mentioning, especially since this is aimed at beginners who might struggle with issues like that. Cheers!",1
"This was truly a whirlwind introduction to API's. I believe it was a little more harder for me as I haven't started to learn JAVA yet (still learning Python). But none less, this is an extremely well done course. Thank you Craig for your work and I will now take another rest as I've reached the end to unscramble my brain.",1
This is easily the best course in this section. Hats of to this guy. Didnt feel like boring bombarment of information. Enjoyed every moment of it.,1
"Such an approachable manner of teaching Craig, thank you. 

Even as a refresher for me, I just felt compelled to keep listening through... 

 Am sure this has been extremely useful for introducing newcomers into coding no end!",1
"I haven't finished yet, but wonderful explanations and great examples so far. With teachers like this learning is a joy",1
I have gone through this course from the beginning to end. It was a wonderful tutorial and now I could write basic sequel queries with confident. I was having very less knowledge about and was not confident in writing queries before. Thank you Mosh and keep up the good work!,1

Love that you tell us EVERYTHING! Most people don’t say the names and numbers on brushes. Your vid’s are GREAT!!,1
"So refreshing to see a beautiful makeup look using primarily MAC products and the production of the video wasn’t over done. Gave old school YouTube tutorial vibes. Enjoyed this so much
You have a beautiful tone and are stunning! Love the manicure as well",1
"This just came up on my feed and I dropped in to say YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! Holy hell, your beauty radiates right from that smile, and your energy is pure and im excited to watch more of your videos💜",1
"I'm enjoying every second of this video !! thank you so much for always putting up videos that are concise, fun to watch and straight to the point ! I'm not sure if you can see this, but I've learnt so many makeup tips from you and add them to my routine bit by bit !! c:",1
You have a very calming energy and i like that you take your time. I like the subtle background music and how detailed you are. Not to mention how incredibly beautiful you look. Thank you for the effort and work you put into these videos.,1
This put me in a total self care mood for tonight 💕,1
"Randomly saw this video on my feed. Like the vibe, nice and relaxing and this is the type of makeup I do on myself. Super hydrating, glowy and minimal.",1
Love this. Perfect every day and put together look 💜,1
Girl you're absolutely stunning! Your voice is so soothing - i can listen to you all day 😍,1
"this video gives me such old school youtube, whenever everyone was doing these chill, informative, makeup tutorials 😫",1
"Can we all just take a minute to appreciate how well produced this was? Great scenario, great lightning, great audio, great animations... Very nice!",1
"Instead of constantly clicking to select an element (especially within a group), you can press CMD, hover over the element you want, and click. It will select that element and save you from multiple (and very annoying) clicks. This was a big game changer for me that I learned while using Sketch. Works on Figma too.",1
This is insane. You literally saved me from taking an 11-hour course. I just needed the essentials to mock up my personal website. Thanks man!,1
Very helpful! I like how you assume that people are coming from a baseline-zero/beginner and go into detail without making it too confusing or lengthy. A true skill! :),1
The best tutorial I've ever watched so far! Easy to understand and very clear! You literally answered all my questions! Thank you so much!!!,1
"Great tutorial! And I like how you said it straight - design isn’t a skill that’s perfected overnight. It’s developed by practice and more practice! It’s great to learn from others too. Figma seems to be a great site to start with - it’s free, user-friendly, and supports collaborative work! It’s a great tool for beginners.",1
"I’m an architect, now I can learn how this design tool works easily. Design is a big process, software is a tool. Great video.❤️👌",1
Super helpful way to get started. I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the sheer volume of material when getting started in UI design. This gives me a way to start building. Thank you.,1
This is awesome and quite inspiring for a fresher like me. every novice in UI/UX need to watch this. I'm almost giving up on designs until I found this video. Thank you for sharing this!,1
"I love how you always include tips in your make up videos, even if you’ve given them before. Because chances are I’ve forgot some or don’t always remember them! And I love that you explain the purpose of the tip or trick.

Love you and your channel 💖💖💖",1
"With my darker skin tone, I tend to do a look like this pretty much year round (gives me a neutral base to start with). I just tend to change the lip color to suit the season. Love it! 😊",1
Gorgeous!! Love the lip combo. It would look good with Jaclyn’s lip oil too.,1
Absolutely love this look I recreated it today I'm obsessed lol thanks girl,1
"What a gorgeous look. Thank you for always giving us tips!  Btw, I saw another YouTuber who compared the amount of the CT bronzer to other bronzers in her collection and the CT had a lot less product in comparison. I guess the packaging is deceiving. Not talking about the how good the product is, just talking about the amount.",1
"I was trying to hold out on busting out the fall decor until September, but all your content and Dunkin' having pumpkin spice back are just two of the reasons I'll be decorating tonight!",1
This look is stunning I love it ! 👏👏,1
Such a beautiful makeup look!!!🥰🥰,1
"I still love my ABH singles. Can’t wait to try this. I tend to always put shimmer on my lid, but I might try an all matte look like this.",1
"Definitely trying this tomorrow on my son. This cut is detailed with all the instructions. Appreciate you sharing this knowledge, stay blessed my brother",1
Did the cut on my son. It came out fire. Crazy what one can do when they believe it can be done. Keep that 🔥🔥🔥coming my brother. Stay blessed,1
"I agree with you on taking a good inch it’s what makes it look blurry instead of compressed darkness because they do half an inch instead this is the same reason why I choose to watch your tutorials. That and the approach you take .. I did notice you change it for a while but I like this more, way less confusing.Thank you for your educational videos.",1
Awesome 👏🏻 thank you so much for this detailed video I tried your techniques yesterday at my haircuts came out so clean 🤩🤩🤩,1
He never misses with the detailed vid 🔥🔥🙏,1
I really liked that you get rid of the lines as you make them!!! Great detailed work!! Thank you for sharing,1
"That blend process looked crazy easy, does Zero gapping your trimmers and clippers make it a lot easier to blend the 0-0.5?",1
"Great step by step and so detailed. MUCHO FLOWWW👏, killing the game. 🔥🔥",1
"You killed it with this video bro, straight to the point and well explained and very detailed! 🤘🏾
Much appreciated, thank you 🙏",1

"Love your tutorials, Mosh! I'm struggling with a Java class, and I did your Python tutorial and really enjoyed it, so I'm doing the Java one and it's making my class much easier. You are a fantastic teacher!",1
Very easy way to learn java with this course. Previously I was always scared to learn java. But this course really boost confidence in me. Learning java with fun. Thanks 🙏🌹,1
"Mosh I really appreciated your work you have done in making this video. At the start, I was thinking that Java will be difficult for me but the way you taught the way you taught us how to write clean code really happy for it. You just made JAVA easy for me and all other ones who are determined of learning it.
THANK YOU!",1
"I watched your python tutorial, the 6 and a half hour one, and made quite a few python projects. I really appreciate the effort you put into these videos, really helpful.",1
"Mosh: Go ahead and spend 10 to 15 minutes on this exercise
Me: *Spends 2 hours* 15 minutes indeed

Thank you, kind sir. I appreciate all the efforts you did to make this as straightforward as it could be!",1

"The problem with this big long video is that I can like it only once! 😁
It's extremely well organised, crystal clear... and free! Thank you so much for your amazing work.",1
"The best tutorial I have ever taken. Structured, easy to go back to, clear examples, keeping it essential, but not trivial. Love it!",1
"After searching for a good Kubernetes tutorial for years, I believe I've finally found the best one! Thanks for a great content and getting directly to the point with the right balance of lecture and demo.",1
"Thanks for the course. Everything is perfectly laid out and delivered. One hour in and I'm looking forward to get further!
As a tech instructor myself, I find this very inspirational.
May I ask you which tool you used to create your animated ""slides""?
Keep up the great work and again, thanks for sharing!",1
"This is an amazing course. Fast paced, detailed and very well thought through. Nana is an expert with great communication.",1
"Nana, thanks for sharing this amazing gift you have for simplifying complex topics. You are so articulate and your mastery of the concepts shows in your delivery of the topics.  I am a fan!",1
My infinite gratitudes for this course! And for docker one! Can't imagine how much of your time and efforts you've put into this work. <3,1
"Hi Nana, you might want to know that the demo project (MongoDB) no longer works with the latest image. I had to use mongo:3.16, which was the latest version at the time you recorded this video. It might be worth adding a note to your video at 1:19:45 that those following along should use mongo:3.16",0

"I just want to say that in my job I write SQL coding every day and I’m branching out now learning C++ just as a hobby currently, and this video is seriously one of the best instruction videos.  

Mike is awesome.  I wish he had a follow-up for teaching advanced C++.  

I just love his way of teaching, it’s excellent.  Precise, not overly wordy and simple, and the best thing is he runs his query after every example so we can clearly see the output.  

Seriously he is the best.  Great speaker and presenter.

Edit:  Just a note, but Mike even explained loops which also occur in SQL and it’s something I honestly haven’t ever really fully grasped before but because of this video I finally get it.  This actually is going to positively effect my job too, not just my hobby.  

Just wonderful teaching.",1
"Great tutorial! Its hard to find someone who explains the basics as well as touching on more commonly used variables. Also, thank you for leaving in your mistakes. It helps knowing that experienced programmers still miss common mistakes.",1
"I needed to learn something about C++ in a hurry.
My first thought was to seek you out (again).
As expected, you were clear and concise and made it all so easy.
You are a superstar.",1
"This was one of the few programming videos which i completed fully, thanks to mike for explaining each and every concept crisp and clear. Eagerly excited to start my journey in programming",1
You taught me more in 4 hours than my professor did in an entire semester,1
Dude I dont know if you know but this tutorial is one of THE CLEANEST CONCISE on youtube. The way you get to the point and explain well in brief manner makes learning C++ seem intuitive. I know this is just the surface but it is presented in a way that makes it feel breezy and effortless,1
"I love how he teaches multiple coding languages the same, it makes learning them a lot easier and quicker to understand",1
"this is awesome, this is how a tutorial should be! i did not think i could have finished it all the way, and right now im already on 3.5. if i can really make some good use of coding, i will surely [join] i'd love to watch more of your tut.",1
"i’ve done some SQL database management in a GUI before but learning to do it through a terminal has been awesome. I would love to see a part two going over primary and foreign keys and database relationships. The way you format your videos is great for learning and i love it, thank you so much for the content you put out. here’s hoping for a part 2",1
I learned more from this video than I did from an entire semester of a watching paint dry intro to databases class. Thanks Chuck.,1
"Yes please Chuck, make more videos about SQL. You read my mind: I just started to make a website with flask for python and a sqlite3 or mySQL database. Thanks for the new video!",1
"19:48 I understand that this is for beginners just starting with sql, but in my opinion you should always delete with unique value (like ""id"" in this case). Because later you'll probably have more than one ""Jeff"". Keep up the good work !",1
"Just wanted to add that having strong knowledge of sql and databases in general is extremely helpful for developing queries and detection rules using tools like Splunk (SPL) or Defender (KQL). Great video, please get in the weeds!",1
"I was just thinking the other day that I really need to start learning SQL, beyond just using it blindly in applications. Great timing and really great intro for me! Looking forward to the next one!",1
"thank you sir, this reminds me of a lesson I didn't understand in class. but you made me understand about SQL in just 24 minutes with enjoyable explanation ☕",1
That was extremely helpful. Wish they would've shown that in school when we were learning about databases and MySQL.,1
"Love how Hayes reviewed SWTOR, saw the terrible tutorial, then made a whole video breaking down an effective tutorial.",1
"One thing with the Dark Souls tutorial, is that the boulder will almost always hurt a new player, so when they get the estus and told to use it, they can see their health increase as a result.",0
"I love how, having grown up with games, I'm just taking these systems for granted and remember being annoyed with some and instantly engaged by others without knowing why. Either I have just been ignoring the obvious to not ruin the illusion or well I'm just not very good at reflecting over my hobby. xD At any rate, thanks for a very informative upload. 

Hail the shadow cabal",1
"John Romero used to say that the first level in the game was the last level he designed. 
By that time, you already know what the whole game is going to play like, and you can use that knowledge to weave it all together seamlessly. 
It works perfectly for somewhat simple games like Commander Keen and DOOM, and I'd like to think that it still works for more advanced or narrative-driven games.

Thoughts?",1
Just the sight of a portal test chamber brings me joy.,1
"It's amazing to me that Guild Wars 1 had such an incredible ""tutorial island""- so much so that people spent _YEARS_ min maxing and living in it as a main point of playing said game and never leaving it for the pure enjoyment of it.",1
"While it is a good idea to seamlessly blend tutorial and initial gameplay, I still have a soft spot for stuff like the Hazard Course in Half-Life, which is an in-universe training grounds for people to get familiar with the HEV Suit, and in turn the game and its mechanics.",1
"Honestly, I feel like the most important option with a tutorial is the option to skip it entirely (for replaying purposes) and the option to revisit it at any point in the game",1
"One of my friends gave up on Monster Hunter Rise because he got overwhelmed by all the mechanics you can interact while having pretty much 0 tutorials. Especially how weapons work and which are their movesets.
As a veteran I really no longer think about that, but it reminded me how not having gradual introductions to the main mechanics of a game can turn many potential players away.",0
"Hey everyone!! Wanted to make a video that we could easily teach you lightroom and get you going, or refer to from time to time as a quick refresher! Love you guys a ton and i honestly hope this helps anyone & everyone out there looking to get better at editing photos! I cant wait to see what you guys can do after this! Feel free to leave any future videos you want to see in the comments, and ill add em to the list!! Have a great sunday!!! - Sawyer",1
"Honestly that was one of the most understandable, intuitive tutorial videos I have ever seen. Many thanks!",1
"I've never really felt comfortable in knowing what I was doing with the tone curve, but this video totally nails it. Great tutorial! So easy to follow. Thank you!",1
"I love how this is NOT a : ""I'll show you the tools but take my private course to really learn something"" kind of video, and I love how you encourage people to learn with differents tools and it's not like ""You do this and that and all done""",1
"Hi Sawyer! Thank you so much for doing this video. I'm six months into my photography business, and finally tackling Lightroom. It seemed super complicated at first, but you truly helped me get over the fear of jumping in.",1
"I could cry! I never make it through a full tutorial, but you have made is so easy and fun to learn! Thank you so much for this video!!!!!",1
"This guy explained it exactly how it needs to be explained! Most people try to do tutorials that seem like they are for professionals, but why would a professional be watching it? Great tutorial!!!",1
I wish I had watched this earlier before I watched all other work flow tutorials. This is not only a work flow tutorial but also a fundamental guide/manual of the software and explains what works how. I understand lightroom much much better now and I'm excited to apply all of these to my next photo editing. Thank you so much. Best lightroom basic tutorial ever!,1
"This tutorial is amazing! Straight to the point, and great energy! Thank you so much, Sawyer!",1
"Hands down one of the best explanations of basic photo editing in lightroom I have ever seen. Simple, to the point, enlightening. Especially what to do where and why. It  helps you leave the 'basic' tab more often and with confidence. I have seen many tutorials, but watching this turned on new light switches of understanding. Thanks!",1

If u ever feel useless in life just remember there are idiotic fools that dislike a 6 hour video of a man teaching how to use python for absolutley free,0
"After 2.5 years, I am returning here to say that I’ve just accepted a job offer for a good salary, and my IT journey started here, from this video, in November of 2019. This was my first source of information, when I got back from work (being a cable tech), and typed “Python full course” or something along those lines. 

Of course, back then, a lot of concepts like classes and inheritance meant nothing to me, and this video perhaps wasn’t the most beginner friendly. However, I was so sick of my job and I absolutely saw no growth in doing cable, where the salary cap for a technician was probably IT jobs base pay for the most part, so I decided to Google every single thing I don’t understand. 

And I successfully changed careers.",0
Never thought I would enjoy a 6 hour programming course! Really nice man!,1
"I'm gonna add myself to the many ""thank you""s! I'm one hour in and I already understood more than I did in a TWO DAYS course I got from work. You singlehandedly gave me the trust that even I can learn python and programming. This video is worth gold to me right now! Thank you Mosh!",1
"Sir I'm a Computer Science Student from India 
And i wanted to learn Python for the off campus foreign placements to the MNC's. 
I came across your channel a few weeks ago and I'm enjoying it 😊
Thank you for your efforts
Love from India ♥",1
This course has literally changed my life. 2 years ago i started learning python from this course and now i am a software engineer intern at a great startup. Thanks Mosh♥️,1
"I am going to say, I have just 3 years as a English speaker (my first language is Spanish) and I understand EVERYTHING that you explain. You put it so simple, very understandable, digestible for real beginners like me... Thank you for putting all the work/time and release these videos for free.",1
"Hi Mosh. Thank you so much for putting this together. I’m wanting to learn python because I’m a teacher with an IT background who wants to find a way to make simple web applications to make life easier for my fellow teachers. I’m mostly interested in creating a way for teachers to enter data (assessment data, house points etc), which can then be collated, summarised and displayed in useful ways.",1
"I am 82 years old, retired - obviously. I started work as a computer operator in 1968 and then moved on to (Cobol) programming. Those were the days! Quite often we would punch our own programs into 80 column punch cards because the girls(!) were busy doing (the more important!!) production work.
I'm really enjoying this Python tutorial course of yours and - so far - finding it quite straightforward with no probs. I'm just doing it for fun.",1
"I'm 6 days away from turning 73 years old, and I'm learning Python!",1
I love the delivery of this course. I'm 66 years old. It just started learning python. Thanks to your course I am quite confident I will progress well. All the best,1

The burger’s was the best ever that we made on our grill! Our son made us follow everything Ramsey said to do! Awesome! Thank you Ramsey and rock on!,1
I know everyone jokes about seasoning and Gordon Ramsay but I just love how passionate he is with cooking,1
I was able to make a perfect burger for the first time in my life by following your recipe and processes. Thank you!,1
"Gordon's solo cooking shows are awesome.  His videos look kind of complicated but they're really pretty straightforward and common ingredients.  I feel dumb for never using a neutral oil (grapeseed) while grilling a burger, that with the seasoning steps makes all the difference.",1
"Gordon Ramsay is a wonderful person, a master of his craft!",1
"He explained all the stuff in one hour which my school been explaining since 4 months.
Respect Sir",1
"I am a totally layman but I finished watching this ONE hour course! So interesting, what a great teacher. His teaching can even attract a person like me who just wish to know some basics of web development. Great job. Thanks Mosh!",1
"I'm a student Software Developer at vocational school and I've learned more in this video than I've learned at school since September.
Great video!",1
"I cannot begin to thank you enough for this video. So many resources teach the syntax, but don't take you through actually applying it. I loved that not only did you explain the various elements of HTML and CSS, but you demonstrated it in a fun, engaging, and easy to understand way that viewers can follow along with. I really enjoyed following step by step. This is definitely one of those things you learn by DOING, not just watching. I've been playing around with visual studio code all day, creating my own little mock websites for fun. Thank you so much, Mosh.",1
"Seeing such a smooth, colorful and professional tutorial I guess anyone would fall in love with coding. Mosh you're the best in creating courses. 🙏",1

"I am a novice who’s transitioning into frontend web development and this is the best tutorial I’ve seen. Well detailed using easy grammar and great explanatory videos. Thank you so much for this, you make it so easy.",1

I love how she literally explains EVERYTHING STEP BY STEP. She’s so cute 🥰,1
Girl you’re rocking more and more every day🥰 Soooo beautiful😍,1
"I come from a radio/voiceover background. Her voice matches exactly how she looks, absolutely adorable. I find her style of delivery to be quite soothing. She should do voiceovers for makeup commercials. I could listen to her all day.",1
"This is amazing. You are so confident and it makes the whole video look better. Just a tip. If you wet a q-tip just a little bit, you can get any mascara or eyeliner smudges off super easily.",1
I LOVED THIS!! Every single product you use and your applications are flawless. Definitely watching more of your content.,1

i love how brad actually understand what an inch is in meanings of hair. 6 months ago i had my hair down to my waist and asked to get 3 inches off my hair. HE CUT OFF 8 INCHES! and it looked absolutely horrendous. i asked for layers and he gave me the CHOPPIEST hair you will ever see. i cried for 2 days straight and went to school in a ponytail for 2 months.,1
"Hi Brad!!!!!!! I'm the girl from the first video. I actually ended up getting rid of the colour because it started coming out. It's now red. Thank you so much for watching!!!

EDIT: for a bit of context. this is the account that i watch videos and comment on. my main is the one that i post on so please can you stop harassing me.",1
"Brad: I don't know what you look like, but I'm sure you look incredible!
Me, laying in bed at 3am with dorito dust on my face and hair unbrushed: Thanks, Brad!",1
I’m really proud of the way that she Took notes literally. Her hair looks adorable on her this is a great style for her. the color is really pretty for her complexion even though she may need to do it one more time to hit all those spots.❤,1
"My toxic trait is watching these and immediately saying “yes, I must try this now.” It turned out great I think! Wavy hair is so forgiving every time I cut it myself hehe!",1
I just did my daughter's hair. And omg we are both loving it. She has curly hair from being biracial and it works so well for her. Why didn't we do this earlier!!!!,1
"Brad's wolf haircut tute was super helpful. i havent' cut my hair myself in years, but I was tired of telling stylists I wanted tons of layers and only getting them at the bottom of my hair. so I said fuck it, watched his tutorial and went in on my hair with my good shears and thinning scissors. Best haircut I've had in years. So thanks Brand Mondo!",1
"I am a retired hairstylist and your videos are very entertaining!! I did that same haircut back in the 80's, on myself and others. It was not called the wolf cut, but was called the Farah, worn by the actress Farah Fawcett from the show Charlie's Angels. I see here it has made a comeback!😊",1

Now this works best with two different wood types but it still looks really cool warped for the sign and slab look best for me.

also does anyone else see spiders in the black and red tericota or nemo fish in the blue orange taracota? might be a story telling ability there. might be fun to explore.",1
"The darker wood underwater technique also works well for showing stepped on vs unused stairs, for instance.  And for paths across rock, substitute cobble and gravel to show the wear.",1
"Not gonna lie, Gordon Ramsay seems like a nice guy teaching us peasants how to cook",1
"I love how he teaches the right timing to turn the food. I usually end up burning it because I'm afraid of undercooking, so it's great to get these pro tips.",1
"I had no idea you had this channel, and are making videos teaching all of us for free.  That’s awesome.  Thank you very much, Mr. Ramsay.",1
I'm watching this while I'm sad and honestly he's kinda wholesome. I feel like if he was teaching his kids how to cook he would teach them in this manner (probably in more advanced recipes since this would be pretty basic to him). He's just a dude that's highly passionate about cooking.,1
even after all these years he's the most enjoyable chef to watch,1
I enjoyed this lesson very much.  I've taught music for 37 years and I recognize good teaching.  Loved that you told people to take their time.  This nurturing technique makes me want to cook and learn new recipes.  Thank you for sharing your immense knowledge.,1
"I've learned so much from these videos. I wasn't a bad cook before, but learning a few tricks in slicing things more effectively has made me actually enjoy cooking.",1
Thank you Chef Ramsay for sharing your talents with me. This has helped me to be better in the kitchen. Blessings to you and your family!,1
what I love about Gordon is he shares everything he learned a lot of chefs keep their secrets but he teaches I love it i have cooked almost everything Gordon has shown I want to personally thank you bc of you my wife loves me more,1
"The minecraft way:
Step 1: Build a 'temporary' box house or cave home
Step 2: After playing for awhile and gathering materials, prepare to build your new house
Step 3: Look up some builds people have done for their houses for inspiration
Step 4: Realize that to accomplish any of those, you'll need to get 10x the resources you already have and spend like 10 hours of dedicated building time
Step 5: Stop playing for 8 months
Step 6: Start playing again, but feel completely lost and confused as to wtf you were doing
Step 7: Decide to start a new world so you can just start from the start instead of trying to remember everything from your current world
Step 8: Return to step 1",0
"Holy gosh. I’d consider myself to be a pretty good builder, but this man’s base puts all my years of building to shame. Amazing job Skip.",1
Thank you for these tips. I’m gonna apply these to my dirt house.,1
For the farm you could also mix in different crops or place a few flowers in the field tall flowers look the best,1
This is honestly one of the best videos you've made... Definitely gives a purpose to some of those really bored minecraft players!,1
*I used this plan to build a kitchen cabinet for my friend **Allmy.Tips** I feel proud to have accomplished such a project which she have come to love so much. Thanks a lot for a collection as this. It is quite comprehensive.*,1
"Easy to use but hard to invent ☝️
Thank you so much for this video! Wish you have massive success 🙌",1
"I love these tips that increase personal comfort and organization. But home value is increased by landscaping and structural improvements. Thank you for sharing... I especially like the 5 gallon bucket stool. I’d love to make this with an open 1/4 for some internal shelving or storage for a personal challenge 😊 ~Sheeara, Alaska",1
Wow! So many amazing ideas for DIY projects! Love them all! Thanks for the inspiration! Can't wait to try them!,1
My daughter wanted me to spend an arm and a leg to achieve the Bohemian look she was going for in her bedroom. This was right on time! Thank you!,1
"Thank you. You have given me lots of awesome ideas on small and cost effective things I can do to stage houses I’m selling. The staging part is extremely important, it makes the houses more appealing to the eye. And if they really like a certain piece and purchase the home I throw it in as a house warming gift. It seem that some of the individuals commenting don’t know how to mute their volume or understand how some of these thing can in fact add monetary and/or personal value to there home.",1
Your designs/ creativity are simple but very effective  (extraordinary) I won't of thought about them. I love all,1
"I love watching and love when you talk about your son. I have 1 child,a son, and the bond between a son and his mom is amazing. He’s 26 now and has his own life and we still love each other so much but cherish him while so young. They grow up so fast.",1
"Nothing is better than coming back home on a sweaty day from school and seeing your favourite youtuber’s new video, you look so beautiful! In my opinion, I feel like 2022 is full of “clean makeup”. This is perfect 🤩 Love you Christen!",1
"With or without makeup, you looks absolutely stunning, Christen!",1
Love how it's such a natural look for on the go n,1
OBSESSED with this look! Your skin looks FLAWLESS 😍🔥,1
I am obsessed with this natural glow look!!! You always look so gorgeous!,1
"I've been watching you for years and I have to say, whatever you've done since back then and now.... you look amazing!!",1
Such a nice nautral look love it,1
can’t wait to try this look! 💖💖💖,1
I love the makeup look 💜,1
When I got the beginning parts I just cried. I’ve wanted to play and have loved film score music my entire life and never thought I’d get to a point of being able to play the songs I love so much. I’m 26 and never played the piano but I bought a piano back in June and the  realization that I actually CAN learn this made me emotional. Thank you for your awesome lessons!!,1
Love your teaching style. I learn so much. You make it look so easy.,1
It really helps when she NAMES the chords and or keynotes.  When she covers the lessons at a slow pace and when the keynotes LIGHT up it is easy to follow along!! 🙏💐❤️💡💐,1
I was just thinking about this theme and how to play it and here it is😂. Go Lisa and Pianote. You guys are awesome 🔥,1
This is so easy to learn. Thank you Lisa! Thank you Pianote! 🎹👍🏻😊💯,1
Just wow. What an amazing teacher and pianist you are.,1
"I've been playing for 50 years now. This is a beautiful 😍 song. I love your ""thumb hack"" wayyyy cool. Keep it up. 💯",1
"Fantastic piece of music, fantastic tutorial. This also helped me to read music better ! 😊🎹💯💫",1
I want to learn this song now. Great job Lisa!,1
I love how he tells us what went wrong and how to do it right,1
"I love that the narrator is particularly enraged at the horrific cheesecake tutorial. Usually the narrator performs with an impersonal, almost inhumane, robot-esque anonymity and objectiveness, but here you start to see their own real personality come through just a bit. Whoever they are, they must be an avid baker to be so enraged by the British woman's baking faux pas hahaha.",0
As a person living in the UK I can confirm this is an isolated incident. I just put the biscuits in a ziplock bag and beat the crap out of them with a rolling pin. This lady made me facepalm so bad.,0
Damn. The cheesecake proved the narrator’s not just a robot capable of occasionally trying out products!!!! He showed actual emotion past making a bad joke followed by “I’ll see myself out” Kay you’ve done us a great service demonstrating genuine emotion in the Be Amazed narrator XD,1
That blood clot remark was everything 🙌  I couldn't stop laughing 🤣 😂,1
Brilliant. I actually 'laughed out loud'. The twins trying to spray freckles on was one of the funniest ever. Thank you so much x,1
As a brit we definitely do not cook like her. Cheese cake is one of the first things I was taught to make as a child. No stove or oven needed🤦‍♀️,0
No one teaches like Mosh Hamedani does. What a legend 🔥,1
Your 6hour Python video on YouTube was where I learnt the basics of Django. I fell in love with Django and started teaching Django on my YouTube channel. Sir Mosh you are the best instructor in the world.,1
Incredibly video. This was really helpful. Mosh's tutorials are always so neatly arranged and skips unnecessary contents. Thank u very much for this and hope to see more tutorials. 😍,1
"Mosh, thank you so much for the countless digestible tutorials! I was able to effortlessly learn Python because of your effective teaching style. Would you be able to make a course/playlist for C++? Thanks again!",1
Amazing stuff. I'm curious though on what would be your approach to setup the VSCode debugger having TypeScript installed as a dev dependency instead of a global dependency.,1
you dont need to go to Harvard to learn programming. mosh is the expert on teaching programming than any universities in the world. trust me i am witness. i used to be one of the people who dont understand coding and got lowest grade in university. but i decided to quit college and bought all his full stack courses. now i fall in love with coding and becoming the best on the field. Thanks Mosh!!,1
"One of the best, perfectly-paced, Typescript tutorials out there. Unfortunate that you don't use curly braces with your if statements. One of the biggest causes of bugs for new and even experienced JS programmers. Hubris is the only reason not to use them.",0
"Thanks for this amazing tutorial. I've just started learning and u made it super easy.
At 30:16 we do get those methods with javascript.",1
"Hello Mosh, great content, I have a quick question for you, I want to buy your course and learn JavaScript and SQL, do you recommend those two if you want a job in QA Automation? I have been watching Postman API videos as well. Thank you for your time.",1
"nikkie: *starts with the “clean girl” aesthetic base*
nikkie: *adds a pound of her most full coverage concealer to make it basically full coverage* 

I EXPECTED NOTHING LESS 😂😂 LOVE U NIKKIE",1
"As a goth, I wear cool-toned makeup often, especially on the eyes. But I totally get why not everybody loves it! I want to say that the lips looks beautiful on you!",1
This is one of the most prettiest looks you’ve ever done. Embrace the lips! The skin! The eyes! Your natural beauty!,1
"It gives a early 2000’s vibe but like an upgrade version, I’m here for it! For me I do dabble in some cool tone eyeshadows myself but this look is everything, specially the lips like it really just pulls the look together I wished I was blessed with the pigment on your lips 😭 either way you look so flawless as always and girl your skin without makeup is so perfect",1
Nikkie should do a full Korean inspired makeup look. Guess that it would probably be her worst fear since it’s all about the natural look.,0
I would love to see you do an actual “no makeup” makeup look!,1
"Her skin is sooo perfect without any make up on, I am really interested in her everyday skin care routine and special things she does (if at all?) and the products she uses!",1
"A cool-toned smokey eye is literally my every day go-to. 😂 This challenge is super fun though, I wanna make a video like this! 🥰🖤",1
"Gotta love her personality,  she looks great for her age, I might not be able to afford those products,  but she can, so kudos to her 🥰🙌",1
"Moisture = Youth
And, clearly Lisa Rinna has got that down.. I absolutely love, LOVE her skin!",1
I really love her skin at the beginning of the video. The eleventeen creams and boat loads of makeup just drowned out her glowing skin.,1
"This video is the definition of “YOU’RE NOT UGLY, YOU’RE POOR.”",0
Except for the eyeliner smudge I think her makeup looks great. I was worried it was gonna look too greasy with all the creams/serums/oils but it turned out great.,1
"She is absolutely gorgeous and I appreciate that she’s like “hey Imma do whatever to feel good about myself and that’s the tea”
Congrats on the beauty line love",1
Love that she’s honest about Botox / filler ..etc.. 😁 she’s very inspiring,1

I can't thank you enough for making this video.  Just got my A7riii and this took me from being lost and confused to zipping around having fun with the camera in a few hours.  You are a fantastic teacher!,1
thanks so much for taking the time to make these. helped me with my first ever camera (a6300) and now again as i finally upgrade to a full frame. you guys to an awesome job and we're all immensely thankful for your efforts :),1
"An essential guide.  I binned the manual and went through this systematically which was 500% better.  Thank you, Tony",1
Thanks for putting the time for this awesome tutorial Tony. Just switched from Nikon to Sony full frame and am extremely happy with it. Can't wait to start my lens collection soon.,1
"Hey Tony,
Long time subscriber. 
Thank you for all of the content you and Chelsea continue to produce. I know this video is a few months old, but would you consider doing a video comparing the camera picture profiles. I am very interested in HLG for Sony and it’s uses in the real world as well as in the editing booth. At the very least, are you aware of any resources for LUTS that help convert back to rec.709?",1
"I just bought the AR3. I want to thank you a billion times for helping me tremendously. I used this tutorial from your AR73 and in some cases some of the stuff I had to move around a bit to find because Sony has moved it in the menus, but I will for sure be getting a good nights sleep tonight thanks to you! Just became a full time subscriber! Thank you thank you thank you!",1
"Thanks Tony, great tutorial. Learned a lot more than the time I played with A350K and A77. Coming from an APS-C to this camera I was a little skeptical, would be able to learn and use all features of my new A7R3 but your tutorial made it so easy that I find myself more familiar with A7R3 than the previous cropped ones. Thanks again and cheers!",1
Thank you so very much for this long detailed very accurate tutorial. I'm a professional photographer who just upgraded to the a7r3 and you have just saved me probably a year worth of learning the camera thank you very much love the channel keep up the good work,1
You're amazing! I usually chuck the manual away and freestyle and explore my camera instead- but today!! I sat through 50 minutes of you guiding me and I've learned so much! the only reason why I stopped is because it's getting late and I need to sleep,1
"I'm motivated at a wrong time..
my will to do sketches again really went 📈📈 when I'm on the busiest days of my life",0
"Just in case anyone is wondering, this technique of drawing heads is called the Loomis Method. You can research more into it and enhance drawing portraits (I personally love this technique myself.) 

Thank you for sharing this po! 🧡",1
I’ve watched so many face drawing tutorials and this one is the only one that actually helped. All of a sudden my faces look realistic and proportions fit. Thank you!,1
So underrated that's so sad...ur skills r absolutely definitely and totally amazing,1
"Enjoying your tutorials, a stress reliever after online classes🍻",1
"she does the work piece by piece, from the sketch to the nose, the eyes and the mouth, this is how you really learn to draw, this video really is one of the best to learn",1
oh myy i was hoping you'd do a face tutorial! your techniques are always so easy to follow along with and help a lot ❤️,1
Never thought I’d see t day where GQ would post a waves tutorial 💀,0
Love this presentation. He is articulate and detailed without being condescending or making me feel like a dufus. Thanks for all the very good info,1
I like what y’all doing here GQ.,1
"Love the video but it brings back painful memories of being a 24 yr old young man with 360 waves, putting Dax pomade in my hair and now 36 and bald with a beard. Life comes at you fast 😆",0
"This was an amazingly tutorial ❤️, I've seen plenty that a great videos but not truly beginner friendly. This is helpful  and engageful and really providing the knowledge needed for a beginner",1
"More hair videos please 🙏🏼
These are great",1
"Also when you’re looking for a brush,get the curved brush. It’ll be easier to get those spots that a regular brush can’t get💯",1
"I love this, it gets straight to the point",1
This is cool I always wondered how this was done. Thanks very informative.,1
Solid tutorial 🙏🏽,1
The “That’s how ya do it!” is just so charming in how it’s said,1
She sounds very calming and motivating at the same time,1
It’s so adorable that he says “Baap” for up and “Doon” for down like he’s actually trying to say it.,1
The fact that GF is teaching BF instead of letting he do all by himself is really wholesome in my opinion.,1
This girlfriend is more supportive than everyone I've met in my life,1
"fun fact: gf was apparently voiced by kawai sprite, who is a guy so that’s cool ig",1
"the ending is like: ""dont worry girl, i got this.""",1
The fact that at 0:52 the boyfriend does something by himself is just so wholesome and cute <3,1
OMG it looks so satisfying,1
Wow 👏👏👏,1
"0:33 
OMG it is so beautiful💓😫",1
Wow 😲😲🥰🥰,1
👏🤩💗❤️❤️💞,1
WOW 🤩,1
Awesome,1
It's lovely 🥰❤️,1
"An hour long Tati video? Unedited, unfiltered and full of makeup? Yes, please!",1
So thrilled for a tutorial!  I miss them in the beauty space now!  (Don’t stop your other content tho!  It’s all great!) ❤️,1
"When Tati talks I just want to listen, she’s so good at explaining and teaching!",1
"An hour long makeup tutorial with Tati?! It will be like we’re literally doing our makeup together! Yes, please!!",1
I would literally watch you for TWO hours! YES to the lives and YES to the unedited video!,1
"Tati, I will watch ANYTHING YOU DO!! I’m totally checking out Ole! That eye cream is calling my name! I’m patiently waiting for the hour long live! ❤️🙌🏻💥",1
I’m all in on an hour long live! I love that we can interact with you in real time.  😁,1
"I'd watch an hour long livestream! Totally! And I just wanted to say that ever since you moved to Texas, you've been looking more and more really radiant and youthful--even completely without makeup. Literally, your bare skin looks fantastic; your color is so much better, so much healthier. It's clear that your new house, environment and climate are working wonders on your energy and well-being! I am so happy for you!",1
"I would love to see lives and unedited content!  I would watch it! I've been here since the beginning and I've been loving your growth!  You seem to be thriving in the new space and I'm here for whatever content you put out.  Sending blessings to you and James! And Puka, of course!  🙌🥰  

I'm shopping this video while watching!  🤣 RIP no buy!",1
Oh Tati I’m ready to care again about how I look. You’re so correct when you said covid did a number on us. Yes please real time extra long videos. I feel like I don’t even remember how to do this. You’re looking fab. 💕,1
So happy to help inspire you Hailey! Love the final look ❤,1
I love how she didn’t shove her brand down our throat in this like most people do when they have new beauty brands. Can’t wait to get my hands on some of the products.,1
I love how supportive she is of her friends and their brands! I love that she uses Ari and Kylie's make up products! It warms my heart to see women supporting other women! <3,1
I loved her. And I love her even more now. She's been consistent with expressing her knowledge towards skin care. She's incorporating it within her line and grew with it over the years. I'm just proud.,1
"She’s so beautiful with and without makeup. It’s so nice to see a young celebrity that doesn’t look overdone with the fillers and plastic surgeries. 
I think she has a gorgeous face and skin and also she has this vibe that seems so nice and so down to earth.",1
her skin is UNBELIEVABLE. not just in this video but over the years every picture of her I notice her skin. She seems very sweet too.,1
She’s so well spoken and so elegant yet down to earth. I see why JB married her. She referred to him as “my husband” which was very classy as well. She didn’t name drop her husband. What a gem of a woman.,1
I love that she used her own products but didn't talk about it for 10 mins and just introduced them like all of the other products that she used. I love her so much! What a queen!,1
"Her skin is literally perfect, she's so passionate about self care & skin care. Makes sense why she chose to start the skin care brand instead of makeup. I absolutely love her skin. Congratulations on rhode, Hailey 🥂💓",1
Never knew I was out of shape until I did this 💀,0
This guy’s positive energy is able to make everyone smile.,1
Bro thank you so much this was literally a life saver💀I have a freestyle dance competition in a few days so thank you so much bro I’m definitely subscribing!😊,1
Someone needs to hire this bro to do a kids television show on how to dance. That “tell me what I just said? 👂” was too perfect,1
Bro thank you man!! Thanks to you I ungraded my dance moves!!! God bless bro!! Keep up the great content!,1
Your energy and demonstration is great bro.. keep it up,1
Tried all these steps after watching this video and I nailed every one of em except I almost lost my balance lol,1
Appreciate you breaking down these dances they are super dope to learn fam🔥🔥🔥. Gotta use a dance for my intro.,1
Good to see more people teaching juggling here on youtube :),1
"Hey, just wanna let you know, I used your tutorials to learn and now 4 weeks later I can almost perfectly juggle about 10~15 times. Still a long way to go, but really amazing tutorials and it was a lot of fun, the journey. Thanks a lot!",1
I've never been able to juggle more than two things in my whole life until now! Taylor makes it so easy to understand! Great tips! Thank you SO much! Self esteem improved +10 pts!,1
"Hey Taylor!  It’s been a while since I watched this video.  I was talking to Joe DiNoto and he said I should let you know that, you are the reason I can juggle today.  Your explanations are great and it was something I always thought were just beyond my ability.  So thank you and please keep up the amazing work.  :)",1
"I really like the way you teach! Got my juggling balls... now I’m going to start practicing. By the way, I am 66 years old and I want to do this to keep my brain working well.",1
Thank you really much! A great thing to learn during lockdown times :),1
Thanks - really clear instructions with great does and don'ts. I'm finally learning to actually juggle - at 67 years old!,1
"Thank you so much for your videos, Taylor!!  Juggling has always helped me deal with anxiety..keeps my mind focused.  It's awesome to learn some new tricks!!  Thank you for the inspiration you give!!",1
"The Education Edition is also a part of the Pocket and Bedrock Edition.
This means that mobile + bedrock players can play Education Edition without paying more than what Minecraft actually costs.
(It is a world setting)
I love it 😀",1
"The feature I love most about education edition is the chalkboards. They are so much easier to type on, give you more room to type, and you can go back and edit them.",1
"Mannn, I really wish they'd bring some of these awesome items over to the java edition! Colored torches and sparklers? Balloons?! Plus there are Pocket edition items I wish they'd bring over too!",1
Back when I used pocket edition I used a lot of these. Glad to know they’re being recognized!,1
Glad to see education is getting some attention sure it’s the version made for learning but it has probably some of the best map making features out of all minecraft versions,1
"I used to play MCEE in school all the time before the pandemic! Even though my teacher probably hated me and all the kids that played games during class, I couldn't help but notice all the anazing things in this version of Minecraft, I basically forgot all about it until I watched this video. It was basically free as it's obtainable to anyone with a school laptop. The laptops were on a LAN so we'd be able to join other player's worlds like parkour, hungergames, or minigames.",1
I actually think that Blaze Rods could be used with Glow Ink Sacs to make glow sticks if Java/Bedrock were to have them.,1
"Ed edition is SO good, it's just sad that it doesn't get much recognition online. Also, the Agent can be used as a portable inventory by spawning it, placing the items in it's inventory and then you can despawn it or just leave it, then resummon it later!",1
She has to be one of the prettiest people to walk this earth,1
"As a makeup lover I have never heard a more expensive sentence than 
“I’m just gonna put a little of this Pat over the Dior” in my life",0
"I aspire to give off her energy, she’s confident and sure while also being calm and genuine. I literally desire to be her essence",1
“I’m still blending because I don’t want my mom to yell at me” 😭😭😭 I love her,1
"you can tell how close she must be to her mum, she mentions her every 2 minutes its so adorable",1
She looks so pretty without makeup ☺️,1
She has that voice which we have in our head when we talk to ourselves 24/7✨,1
"Not to shade anyone but being Latina I'm glad to have some representation in the form of Alexa. Maybe because I really admire her, but I can relate more with her in the sense she's not the typical Latina bombshell. She's still a bombshell and one of the most sensual and confident women I've seen and I really like how she's connected to her feminity. Love her authenticity as well",1
"I needed these! I literally love their hair and how voluminous it is! School starts soon for me, and I literally want mine to look like Paislees it’s probably my favourite! She’s gorgeous, and so are all the other girls! Love from Canada!  xx",1
"It was super satisfiying watching Tiffany do ElleCee's hair. I always see how beautiful her hair is and how much effort Tiffany puts in. Thankyou so much for this video, it was super helpful! 💖💖",1
can we appreciate everything they do and let’s just Give them a thank you for posting even in the hard times! This family never disappoints us❤️,1
"I love how you guys do your hair! This school year I wanted to start curling my hair and I never knew how, but I’ve always wanted my hair to look like your guy’s! So this was perfect! Love your guys channels so much!",1
"Can we appreciate the fact that nayvee was sick feeling and still decided to film for us like how awesome are these girls? Also all of their hair looks stunning 🥰 
👍Like for the Nelson girls😁",1
"Can we all agree how pretty all these girlies are !  💖🥰😍 I’m honestly so jelly of nayvee and Paislee especially 💖
I love you all my day is instantly better after watching ur videos",1
So cute!! Great Job guys! I just leave my hair down for school but now since school is coming up I might start putting in hairstyles!<3,1
I swear these kids are so so lucky indeed to have you as there mother!!!❤️ and you as the mom are so so lucky to have these amazingly stunning kids!! Much love!,1
Can we all agree these videos are never disappointing ❤️,1
Hey everyone just FYI the video is mirrored for you to follow along.,1
Thank you for teaching us sir thank  you again👍,1
"*me follows steps perfectly and slowly and succeeds*
also me: ok now let's try it faster
me again: *forgets how*",1
🥳 I am 58 years old and I am “going” to moonwalk now!! This is the best video ever for “how to moonwalk!” 🕺 cheers buddy! Brilliant! Thanks for the lesson.,1
The best kind of tutorial is where you make the person both feel capable and excited to train the move. This accomplishes that in abundance. Awesome work!,1
"If i learn this, you’ll never see me walking forward again",0
"You've really focused on the essentials  of the technique, that helped so much! I've tried to learn with other tutorials before, but didn't seem to make any progress. 5 minutes with you and I got it! It worked at once 😊 Thank you!",1

"That glass pane-beacon thing was neat, I liked that. Though I find beacon beams kind of unsightly in general. I kind of wish you could have the boosted effect without the beam. I know Vanilla Tweaks has a resource to have them be invisible to me, but that doesn't mean EVERYONE isn't seeming my base just SURROUNDED in beams. Maybe they could make tinted glass function as a ""beam nullifier"" while still maintaining effects? That'd be nice.",1

"Homes are being way overvalued, time  for sellers to come down to reality.",0
This painful plateau of economic misery will continue for years. There are too many forces propping up the market. It'll never get back down to the average person anymore because the institutional money will grab much of the property before it does. There are also so many more options for homeowners than simply selling now. Sideways for years to come and the next generations go downhill. Hopefully it was worth the greed of the asset bubble the Fed created.,0
"Not a great time for buyers. Right up until prices crash and BlackRock comes in and sweeps em all up on the cheap, in cash. Homeowners that can't pay an absurd mortgage can rent for exorbitant rates after they boost the prices back up. You will own nothing- and you will NOT be happy.",0

"The two major nuclear disasters happened because of 1 incompetence (Chernobyl) and 2 natural disaster (Fukushima).

"I think anyone who has spent time working in a modern, agile corporate environment could tell you the crux of the problem in an instant: we no longer plan past the next quarter.  ""Supply chain bottleneck"" is just another way of saying that we let the beancounters run the show, and they were good at it right until something happened which they could neither model nor predict (cerveza).   The system is brittle by design, because it's so much cheaper that way.    Nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos:  it's a huge engineering lift, it takes 20 years to pay itself off, you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts, machine them, weld them, then certify and maintain them over a period of 40+ years.  Instead we've been gleefully shutting profitable factories at home, gutting workforces, funneling everyone into college resulting in massive brain drain / skill loss as the old timers machinists retire, but hey, we delivered a lot of value for shareholders.   And now the chickens are coming home to roost.",0
"Excellent video, Marko! Things look really bad for now. Just recently it was reported that Germans (among many others, probably) already spend their savings to fight inflation (instead of having their salaries rise to cover it). I don't want to imagine what will happen in the winter when the energy bills will really increase, or when those savings run out.",0
"Great video again, Marko you did a great job 🙌

Sadly The Netherlands was not in your list as a viewer or replied on your videos 🤣
In addition I can tell that after the Fukushima nuclear incident in March 2011 the EU banned nuclear power plants due to risk of a second Chernobyl incident.
The thru regulations Coal was stamped as dirty and Gas was the second best option after Nuclear power.

If we go back into history the North European countries (the Netherlands also) build the infrastructure for gas pipes in cities and villages. Since there wasn't a need to change and Gas was promoted after 2011 the perfect storm was created. Now there is need so the Coal and Nuclear power plants are being restarted to for fill the energy need.

From my point of view these things should change:
- Nuclear is the way to go
- Create a military security perimeter around Nuclear power plants
- The western world shouldn't be working with Russia nor China for Energy or any productions due to the believe differences and reliability.

Furthermore, the ECB cant loosen any monetary policy because there is nothing to stimulate with 0% intrest rates, the financial unstable countries (you call them PIGS) Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain and with this structural inflation problems. Russia knows this and the ECB messed up big time.

Last but not least, the EU but also the USA, Canada, Australia and Japan need to stop applying QE, start paying debts and slowly deflate for the upcoming 5 to 10 years... if not this system will implode and nothing will be affordable.

Thanks again Marko",1
"Hi Marko! I'm living in the Germany (not born though) and have been following your podcast because you do good analysis.  Honestly, as a european, I feel quite disappointed by everything. I understand why the administration decided not to invest in nuclear energy after Fukushima accident, but on the other hand I cannot understand how they didn't invest in other resources, or should I say how the Europe, especially Germany didn't diversify when it comes to energy suppliers. It's like you said, they just ignored that fact, even though we already had a couple of years ago possible no delivery situation with Russia.",0

The reality is that crypto/stock market is one of the toughest mental games in the world. Building wealth involves developing good habits like regularly putting money away in intervals for solid investments. Financial management is a crucial topic that most tend to shy away from, and ends up haunting them in the near future. Putting our time and effort in activities and investments that will yield a profitable return in the future is what we should be aiming for.

Point 5 - Hello! 👋 Aged 39 and I moved back in with my mum in order to start a new career. At first, I felt a little ashamed of doing this, but the reality is wonderful. Spending time with my mum after many years of being 'busy.' She is very supportive of my goals and my rent is cooking lunch and dinner every day (which I love!)

"if MU fans really want the glazes out, you have to hurt them where they care the most --- money. boycott the club commercial sell and their sponsors, lower their TV broadcast views/stadium attendance/social media activity ratings, etc.  all these together will brought down the valuation of the club, really weaken the glazes's position and help potential buyers. protest along is meaningless. before that, i doubt anything will happen.",0

What a gift! Relating the great literary masters to educate and dymistify financial matters....wow...what a gift. Thanks Lewis and Professor Mihir Desai for another drop in the ocean moment. Off to  check out Professor Desai's website. Thank you. I feel very optimistic in understanding financial matters now😊Just gotta think about Mr Darcy and all the going-ons in Pride and Prejudice and other classics. Brilliant. Thank you.,1

"Its great to hear from a great professor views  on empathy, humility, encouragement and  how everyone can become great. Really appreciate it !!",1

Always good to hear your thoughtful and logical analysis. I don't care about bullish or bearish market. Trade a small percentage of your portfolio rather than going in and out every couple weeks trying to time the market trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 8.4 BTC when I started at 3 BTC in just few weeks implementing Jim Smith and tips..,1
"Dude thinks wage increases are the cause of inflation when it has been massively under inflation and people are being payed less value year after year since the 70s. They mass printed, haulted production and services, filled their balance sheets and took on massive amounts of debt. Wage increases are a result of dilution, not the cause.",0
"*To reach your potential, you need to start doing.* Investing remains the smartest way to prepare for the unexpected. Been in the space for 7yrs and extremely pleased with the decision I made. The good news is — it’s not too late",1
"If inflation stay at current level soon or later the bond market will collapse, then following will be the collapse of stock market. There is no other option but to keep tightening money supply until inflation back to sustainable level. This is the effect of 20 years of horrific monetary policy (QE + too much stimulus). The FED added 25 trillions of debt to it balance sheet since 2000 and all the plans to reduce it deficit have failed and in the contrary they continue to increase the deficit each year. They can blame the Ukraine War or COVID that caused inflation but the reality is just poor monetary policy made by the central government over decades. The only question left is how much tightening they can do without causing a hard recession in an already vulnerable economy.",0
Learning from the professionals....  thank you!,1
"Economy's fine, no cause for concern, just like in 1980, 1990, 2001, 2007, 2020, right?.  The problem is:  the economy is a mess because the money supply and fiscal policy is too loose, but the economy is now dependent on a loose money supply and loose fiscal policy just to function.  So no matter what you do 1) Nothing 2)Tighten  or 3) Loosen, the economy suffers.",0
This introduction for corporate finances is for me. I loved the explanation of the business life cycle in the market. I like the Advisory side of explanations.  My God this is great.  Sound video to see On you tube.  I am looking the text book to review this things so I can understand it correctly. Correct video and accurate explanations. Nice one mr.

Nice one sir. God blessed for your great explanations.I really need to know  more about this class. Can you talk about the Analis and horozontal vertical percentage I want to know more about them even the ratio I want to  know more about them.

"Freeing your mind from consumerism is so important. We're literally trained from young to always want more, to never be satisfied to compare ourselves to our neighbors and what they have. I was always a natural saver, but struggled a bit in not comparing myself to others. It's still something I work on, but over time have gotten better. It definitely helped that I realized the image others put forward, the majority of the time is financed by debt! That's not something I'm interested in at all. I hope more people learn this concept and actively practice it. I'll definitely talk about it on my channel as well.",1

"Funny enough, the argument that Bitboy's business is ""advice"" is incredibly dangerous for him. Coming from someone who IS actually registered to give financial advice, there is a lot of regulation around who can give financial advice, and what you can say if that's your business. Needless to say Bitboy has probably violated a few rules on that front. Normally, YouTubers are protected from liability because their business (YouTube) TECHNICALLY isn't advice-based. Admitting your business IS advice-based, though, might open you up to liability.

"Hey Erling. Paralegal here. I saw the end of your video, but would still recommend getting an attorney to help with handling this suit. Lawsuits are not fun in any way (unless your the attorney/firm) and they cause an unimaginable amount of stress. My parents were victim of a certain suit and it really followed them everywhere and lingered in the back of their minds always.

Moreover, if the other side has an attorney, they have the advantage of knowing how the system works, such as what needs to be exchanged during the discovery phase (Rule 26a dislcosures, interrogatories, evidence you intend to use at trial, depositions of plaintiffs, defendants, and expert witnesses, etc.) and when to make appearances for compliance meetings with the judge. 

I truly admire your resolve to stand your ground and defend yourself. Just be careful with how you proceed. Pay attention to deadlines and what needs to be done. Also remember it's a legal system and not a justice system. 

This is not legal advice, just a concerned fan. Lawyers or other legal professionals, please correct anything I may have overlooked/unintentionally misconstrued. 

P.S. I think the service (the guy who threw the papers at you rudely) was fine, unfortunately. You identified yourself. Once that happens, they can just leave it at your doorstep.",0

"I< appreciate the content you put out on YouTube. I enjoy watching your videos.  I respect you for applying your experience and knowledge into an investment decision and putting your neck on the line by making it public. You may be right on this trade, but if you are right, you better also short the US market as well. Because if the Chinese market collapses, it will pull down the US market with it! Thanks Buddy. Previously Bitcoin has been fluctuating between the $20K and $25K price marks. Billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price, particularly in the last four weeks. The loss has become the primary cause of several firms’ liquidation issues in the crypto industry. I think the direction is upward movement, with a bit of silence before the storm, agree it's boring for the past few days. a good strategy for hoddler'ss moving forward would be to buy now, and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn, the rise will surprise everyone. As for traders, you make money anyways, in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions. If you’re a modern investor then your main aim I guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility. Well good-news you don’t have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with Mrs. Robin Moore and the rest will be a good history of profits for you. I have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop 17.03 BTC with 5.07 BTC with her trade signal despite the state of the market. Her trade signal yield a lot of dividend only if you are paying attention to her instructions. The good thing of this strategy is that whatever happens we have an opportunity to make some money trading with it not minding the sideways in the crypto market.

"I <,watch your videos for your real talks and you never disappoint.. Keep going. You've reminded me of what someone once said The mind is the man, the poor is in it and the rich is it too"". This sentence is the secret of most successful investors. I once attended similar and ever since then I have been waxing strong financially and I most tell you the truth. The bulls have been in control of the market for more than a month. They have managed to push the price by more than 100%. The majority of this rally has been without a considerable correction, begging the question if one is pending following the test of the critical $2K level. One thing is certain, nobody knows what is going on. Our leadership in the country couldn’t be any worse, from the press to the feds, they are all terrible. They say you can’t time the market, but this one was easy to see coming. Every man , woman and child no matter the age needs financial assistance. Doesn’t matter if your young or old we all need the stimulus check / checks ASAP. That's the major reason why one have to invest in crypto but not only investing rather invest and trade your assets for the gains. It's unfair on how things have turned up to be due to inflation, things has been so difficult but BTC/ETH trading has helped me maintain financial stability. Although I believe that the benefits of successful trading come from an expert and that is why I made huge profits with the help of Mr. James Wilson, he is a genius and that is why I always advise beginners/investors to trade with professionals like him. So far I have been able to increase my crypto trading portfolio from day trading from 1.07 btc to atop 13.01 btc with the accurate trading signal provided to me by James and I'm an attestant to the accuracy of his trading strategy. You all in search of a way to recover your looses from the crash and accumulate more profits can reach out to him for mentorship and profitable trading system on ͲeIєɠɾαm👉 (Jameswilson21)   Cheers thank me later",1
"Great content, I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naïve, the sphere have seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I'd say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 10.2 BTC when I started at 3.5 BTC  in just few weeks copying and implementing trades with signals and insights from  Feven Lena. I would advise y’all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you aren't sure about..👌",1

"Thank you for your videos mate,its normal to see so many investors panic amid a worsening bearish market but it is also important to note that the market situation is nothing new in the crypto world. Several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation, a shaky stock market, rising interest rates, and recession fears. As a result, bitcoin has dropped significantly from its all-time high, breaking below several key technical levels. As a crypto investor, the current situation might seem bleak. However, there are several tried and tested expert-suggested investment strategies that can help you accumulate the current crypto storm, in few weeks of implementing trading with accurate signals directly from Mr Ryan Donald, I have been able to accumulate over 11 btc despite the current state of the market",0

"<High inflation was never a reason to sell<The definition of inflation is that prices go up versus fiat, essentially. Logically, that would make sense even for stocks, but especially for a commodity that's been known for many years as an ""inflation hedge.""

"I live in the Netherlands, Europe. And got news for you, we are already in an energy crisis. Gas price has gone 12x at the moment compared to prices pre Covid. That translates in 4x the price if you need a nrw energy contract. So people here pay easy 600 a month instead of 150 euro.

They need to utilized as a measure of self sufficiency, energy independent, and security. The idea they haven’t thought of this is crazy.  To rely on countries that harbor governments that brutalize their own citizens is not good business. Did you turn your back on the bully at school?

For your info, Suppo. Syscoin has been there for a while. I give you that, but for the last year, they have been renovating and adding new stuff to their dual L1, UTXO chain that is merged mined with BTC and a NEVM chain that offers smart contracts flexibility. These base layers will be kept for data availability (DA), to pave the way for their own L2s and , thus, infinite scalability. They are leading the way for modular blockchains. 
Please look into it once u find time.

"I < must say that you are the most erudite and smart analyst in the crypto space. First of all, you're just awesome! I've been following for months now and the cinematic videos, excellent insight and comedic tone are outstanding. Before anything else, I would like to say that no one can exactly predict in days how long a bear or bull market could last or how low and high the prices can go, but we can try to make predictions using past events, I think prices should run up a lot now, punishing panic sellers and forced sellers. Most new traders struggle at first to make sense of the markets and how to put their portfolios in a position to flourish. Many try to start on their own and quickly end up with a string of losses, slowly seeing their accounts dwindle to what they started off as. Everyone is looking at the bitcoin price action from a 2021 bull run perspective. Everything has changed…we are in a recession, facing stagflation, rising rates, and energy shortages driving food and living costs through the roof, breaking consumers’ backs. <There are different strategies to profit from the crypto market but holding and waiting for a major pump is not the best way to earn profits off the market, smart investors trade and take short-term profits.

"I love how you do focus on more than just crypto. Two quick questions. If we do start wave 5, any guess as to roughly what the peak would be? Is that the overall .4236 extension? Second, what happens next? If it hits that overall high, I expect a crash, but what if wave 5 doesn't get that high?",1
Awesome video BCB. Thank you. But What does wave 5 in the stock market mean for the alt coin market ? Would we have enough time for ETH to finish that fractal you mentioned (the beginning of the super cycle) . Also the merge is coming in a few weeks. Is Bitcoin going up to 40k considered a retracement that we need for the alt coin season we all want ?,1
"What I love about you is that you never speak your bias as gospel. You give everyone the freedom to decide for themselves without shoving your bias down their throats, and potentially brainwashing them to think what you think. You present each argument clearly and concisely. I particularly love the breakdown explanation of Elliot Wave theory, and what actually happens psychologically with the market participants. Well done brother. Have a good one! 😉👍✌️",1

"I’ve been trying to go active on FTX US for the past four months. Each time I try to reach out to support, I go through all the hoops to put in detailed information of what my problem is and I get the same canned response that does not address my issue. It’s a shame I plan on using them but if they can’t get me set up I can’t use them. To successful I guess to really care about solving something as important as I’m boarding a new customer.",0
"I< think the difference in this instance is that analysts are stating that we are heading for a DEPRESSION! so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new ATHs. Great points in your video. I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to S&P/Nasdaq and Altcoins to BTC. Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective. So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom. That short-term thinking is such a rookie mistake. By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years, it takes the guesswork out. Next bull runs it won't be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k. What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low. I'm really holding on for this possible low point reentry, I screwed up some time back & I need this lower point to get back in, I’ve small cash on the sideline I don't like that but I refuse to FOMO in. Our younger investors are scared, they're concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before. My advice to them is this, go all out into trading. Trading is where the bucks are been made. I see the stock market, housing values going down, and crypto going up. Traditional markets are getting recked. The new economy is crypto, not fiat. People want truth, not corruption, contracts not monetary easing. Venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment Advisor Mr.Kyle Miller.

So many exciting projects like Defi Kingdoms, Star Atlas and many more.. all building through the bear. Even your own projects.

Do traders convert BTC into a stablecoin when they feel the price is high and wait until the price drops down and ""buy back"" by converting back into BTC? is this what people do? also would convertions into different cryptos be classed as a selling it for tax purposes? thank you for any advice, all the best, Kieron",1

"Thanks<, for the update I always appreciate the insight. <I'm really blown away by the fact that having watched your videos for so long, I had the same opinion that you are putting forth in this video. <In as much I would like to add to what you have said here the market is in a tug of war with the bull at one side and the bears at the other end. If this is really a bear market rally then Bitcoin is not done going down, just like stocks are not done going down. And if this isn’t a bear market rally and the Fed achieves a soft landing, Bitcoin will probably rally substantially from where it is now, but we just have to wait and see.  My hope is that by the fourth quarter, the economy will be slowing enough that the Fed says we are going to pause, and then you will see the next crypto cycle start. I have witnessed the last 3 cycles and just before each bull run the amount of bear posts and negativity around crypto is just like it is now. Bitcoin is entering the area of where a bottom will be formed IMO. Please note this could take months and there will likely be further volatility in both directions.

The truth is that the market remains unpredictable especially in the long-term.

Could this outcome be a sign that the market is ready for a bigger recovery?

BTC's price has been fluctuating lately, but I think we should be educating the newbies on what to do aside holding rather than discussing about the dip.

Nowadays it seems like you’re the only one who still does it. I enjoyed every minute of this long video, and I also salute how much effort it would’ve taken to solve all those puzzles.",1
You should try the MGC square-1. It's what all the top solvers use these days. The MGC 7x7 is also really good,1
"Octopi can fit through any area that is equivalent to the size of their beak. Also if anyone didn’t know, mollusk have beaks. Also, octopi are mollusks. Thank you for this amazing video, well done good sir!  Definitely gave me some ideas as far as new puzzles and potential mods. I appreciate the time you put into filming and production as well. No matter what anyone says that, just remember you’re DOING IT! If you feel unhappy with even the slightest things in a video, always remind yourself that you are doing something when other people aren’t. I’ve been watching your stuff for years and have always enjoyed these cube collection videos. Thank you again for your content!",1
This is gonna be a fun movie!,1
I'm surprised it only took 22 hours to solve the cubes. This project is insane! Well done good sir!,1
Your persistence and creativity know no bounds Mike! This is amazing. And how amazing is Daily Puzzles!!,1
I appreciate your honesty about the power of being an influencer.,1
"Really cool that you didnt immediately spoil what the image was gonna be, such a cool picture",1
"This is Mike saying ""I'm back."" in the most Mike way possible.",1
this is insane!! respect!!,0
Its super interesting how parts of the image look gray from a distance despite there being no actual gray on the cubes,1
"Mike somehow manages to surprise us and top himself with every new video, Keep up the great work!",1
"As a cuber, this video is so good. Usually, cubing videos made my people who know less about the hobby get things very wrong and mislead people, but not you! Also, DailyPuzzles is a great store, good to see you giving them exposure!",1
"First 500$ cube unboxing, second 300$ cube unboxing, third 100$ mystery, fourth $200+ and now $2000+. I'm impressed",1
"Thanks cube head for your amazing content, love your cubing content. Definitely on the top cubing content creators for me.",1
Dude... I just want to say your videos are so good and are just getting better and better!,1
Let me find 20 minutes of my life to watch this masterpiece later today 😛,1
"8:16 dude, this is why you're one of the best cuber YouTubers, I'd say even my favorite. Made my day",1
When a new video comes out I literally put everything down just so I can watch it. You’re the best cubehead!!!,1
The Idea for the cube lube vid sounds like a banger! I really love setting up my cubes and I think that the Yoo cube setup is probably the best one out there especially because it works on almost every cube.,1
"Thanks for making excellent content, keep up the great work and congratulations on 200k subscribers!!",1
"hey cube head quick question, have you got a package from the cubicle that you haven't unboxed on your channel? also love your videos.",1
"Like this comment if you think I have a career in opera. (Please don't)

Edit: everyone complaining about the 14, 16 and 18, see the video description.",0
"I own a 0x0. Super hard to solve, it keeps slipping through the atoms of my hand.",0
The transition from 6x6 to 7x7 was great!,1
I love how the 9x9 is so smooth,1
It’s interesting how they get rounder the more blocks you add,1
I love how after 10x10 the surfaces stop being flat,1
When you level up in a game and there's so many dang rewards:,1
"4:40 cubers be like: wtf, how is 1 hand inpressive, he can’t even do it in 30 seconds",0
I thought he was cuber but this video first part is satisfying ❣️,1
Awesome video! I could never solve those at all! How do ppl do that? Great job!🙂,1
"On the thumbnail, a 30x30 Rubik’s cube would just completely fall apart if you turn it without increasing the size of the outer layers",0
"4:27 being a speedcuber watching him say “How do you even do that one handed” hurts me inside
Edit: everything about this video hurts me inside",0
1 wrong move and it's all gone.,0
"I finally solved this cube after i’ve been having it for 4 years! July 25, 2022. Thank you so much for being an amazing guide for this cube, Robbie!",1
Thank you! I used this video when I started cubing now I’m down to 11 seconds as my best time with AT LEAST a year of practice. I now average about 19 seconds and love speed solving!,1
"Even though it took me a whole lot of practicing to achieve, I am so glad to inform you that I can now solve the cubes without the video. Thanks to you😊",1
"15 tries, 3 meltdowns, and 1 cry of happiness later, I have officially solved my first Rubik's Cube!",1
This tutorial is the greatest there ever was! We got our son a rubix cube for his birthday and we have been working on solving this and it finnally paid off! Solved the cube because of this tutorial and it was glorious!,1
You are genuinely a great teacher. I finally solved my first Rubik’s cube at age 47 after so many years of frustrations. Now I can teach my 7 year old son!,1
Finally got it solved!!! My very first time solving a Rubik’s cube. Thank you so much for this video.,1
Let's appreciate how much effort and humor are in his videos! Hope 1M Soon,1
"Pretty cool video, you explained with humour how is a so huge number possible, well done 💪",1
"This video is sick, thank you for making it! I’m really curious about why we divide by 12 to account for the cube states that aren’t possible, like a single misoriented corner or edge. Can anyone explain why? Thank you!",1
Nice loop 👌,1
"I love ur editing and also wow , when you just look at a cube, you don’t think that there’s 43 quintillion combinations. Cool",1
NO WAY 2 VIDS IN ONE DAY?! THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER!,1
"as usualy great content and great editing 

😁",1
"Great win, few more hit 7000,  👍 well played Roshtein... cheers 🍻",1

Respect to this lad! Just solved my first 3x3 cube and it took me 2 hours.. I cant imagine how difficult that must be... amazing!! You earned a sub mate!,1

"Congratulations man, this was really an INSANE effort. You goal was almost impossible and you did it. I really can't imagine solving big cubes for 5h OMG",1
"I really congratulate you, my hand hurt even just watching it, I don't know how you endure this pain, but I can say that you are a really patient and determined person, although I love this video, you shouldn't push yourself so hard to show us these, you can produce simpler content anyway, I wish you continued success",1
Mind-blowing brother 😮🙏 . Incredible 🧠🤯👏. Love from India 🇮🇳. Huge respect for you ❣️.,1
I really likes your method for the 3x3 tutorial. I can now solve it like 30 seconds even though i'm kind of a beginner.,1
"You are a legend
You deserve great respect for this",1
"You are Really a hard worker 🖤 
I loved that you were doing ... 
I'm also a cube lover but I'm a beginner.. 
I really appreciate what you did!",1
Amazing work Ryden! You’ll be under a minute in no time! How good are Rubik’s cubes right? 😍,1
Go Ryden great work we LOVE this thanks for sharing!,1
Wow...good job!,1
It makes me feel so proud because I was about his age when I learned how to solve my first rubik's cube...,1
Hey Ryder as a cuber with a sub 30 average just I recommend smooth and consistent movements to speed up. However you’re doing amazing. You will get 1 minute in no minute and you are so fast for not much practice. Keep working buddy.,1
I am beyond proud of Ryden. I’m a speedcuber this is so amazing to see,1
I love how Ryden sticks his tongue out while he is trying to solve the cube lol,1
my goodness it took me literally 6 months to get past the second layer and get to the speed I'm at today....congrats ryden,1
Great work I actually need help solving my Rubik’s cube !,1
"I want to ask you to watch to the end but I also don't. 

Also thanks for everyone who said you're on Team Tingboy ❤️ I'll let him know!",1
"I always love Tingman’s video not just due to its high quality, but also that it’s very wholesome 😊",1
I genuinely like the mini gan 3x3 over the 17x17 just because I’m a gan fan and because I can only solve the 3x3…,1
I am kind of a non cuber but your videos are still very good keep up the great work 👍 👏,1
4:55 The 17x17 is definitely a bigger milestone than the 13x13 🤣,1
This is so hilarious! Imagine if Olor throws the 17x17 to the GAN 330,1
"Hi Ting man, thank you so much for your private message Arlo absolutely loves it.  We would like to know how many cubes you have?

You can't use the timer on a black surface as black doesn't reflect infrared light (try using it on a white table),0
"The 251M is a great cube, the newer versions,  which are one of the Air, Leap or Pro and the Air has not as many features as the Pro and Leap, and the Leap just has bigger core magnets than the pro, which can sometimes be a disadvantage, i main the 251M Pro, with the default GES and set it up with 2-3 drops of DNM which stops most of the catches and lockups.",1

Ese cubo azul se mira que se ah de aentir muy satisfactorio girarlo ❤,1
i personally love the look of stickerless they just look so much cleaner imo,1
I really appreciate you covering the colorblind aspect. I have to have grey instead of green and black instead of orange on my cubes because of my color deficiency and it means significantly less choice in cubes. It's very frustraiting.,0
"It would actually be nice to have stickerless cubes reproducing the scheme of stickered cubes with black lines around the pieces. This is the reason why I prefer stickered cubes, the alternance between colors and black (kind of like shadows) make each piece stand out more and you get this really cool 3D aspect like you can really tell each piece is a small cube in itself, which with a stickerless cube is just not possible, it just seems like one big cube. Do you know what I mean?

Edit: I guess what I wanted to say in a few words is that stickerless cubes visually have a lack of depth which I don’t really like.",1
"What I find good about stickerless is that you can be almost 100% sure that if you're buying a stickerless cube, it will turn at least half-decent, while on stickered you may run into unfilleted cubes that require wrist rotations, like the Original Rubik's series. Of course, you always look closely at what you're buying, but it just seems like an interesting little detail to think about. :)",1
"That's the first time I see someone talking about colorblind speedcubers. As a colorblind guy, I always had a stickered cube. Thank you for talking about this a little bit. Love your vids.",1
I competed back when stickerless was illegal so I was thrilled when it was legalized. Just to find I enjoy stickered more. I like when the stickers get worn. It shows mileage on a cube which I think is cool,1
"For me, whether or not the cube is stickered actually matters a lot. I have always used a stickerless cube, and when I got a stickered cube, I noticed that I was a lot worse at look ahead - I made more mistakes in F2L and took longer to look.",0
"I have always used stickerless cubes, from when I learned all through now.  One day a friend and I swapped cubes to see how our times got affected by using each other cubes (I like my cubes fast, he likes them slower).  His main was a stickered cube.  Not only was I turning bad because the cube was slower then I was use to, but the stickers felt so WEIRD.

I just cant use stickered cubes because of the edge on the sticker.",0
"I prefer stickered on 3x3, because I love the look. Any bigger cubes, the amount of stickers just makes it not worth it to me, to many that can get damaged, and replacing stickers gets exponentially more annoying. I would probably feel differently if the stickers from SpeedCubeShop weren't as good as they are, so I would still take a stickered 3x3 over a stickerless, given the option.",0
"You can get the cube here 😊

Now at last  I solved it for the first time in my life. Easy and perfect tutorial,1
I've looked at so so many videos trying to to do this correctly and this is the first video that helped so so much thank you!,1

I was at a trampoline park and after I was done jumping I decided to play some arcade games. I won 500 tickets from one game and got my first rubiks cube from there. It was really bad at maneuvering and would cause so much friction. So I decided to try and move it really fast back and forth and it literally blew into pieces in the middle of the parking lot and scattered everywhere mid-day with spectators around. Safe to say I could never get it back together. I ended up buying several speed cubes and I’m able to solve all of them.,0

Solved it in two days , now I can do it without watching. Thank you for being a great instructor!! I’m working on a faster time now. I can do it in about 6 minutes.",1
I’ve tried so many tutorials and this video was the only one that was able to teach me how to solve it! You explain everything so thoroughly and in a way that’s easy to understand… you should make a tutorial for the 4x4!,1
"This tutorial is AMAZING! I was a bit confused at the end when finishing off, but I eventually solved it hours later. I can't believe it only took 2 days for me to solve! That's really amazing for a beginner. I really expected it to take WEEKS, but it was only 2 days!",1

"You are a fabulous teacher.  No ego, showing off or any of the things that discourage new cubers.  So clear and user friendly.  I am an older person who has cubed for 15 years. I solve many cubes, cuboids, odd shaped magic cubes, and supercubes and these often require the basic moves you teach here.  So while this is very beginner it is also very useful for advanced complex cubes that can't be solved with advanced algs,  A pleasure!! I will show this video to a young neighbor whom I just gave a 3x3 and she is very excited about it.  I feel she'd do well with your great teaching style!!",1
I have been trying to solve a Rubik’s cube for a year and your video has made me very confident around Rubik’s cubes. Thank you for making this video!,1
I solved my first Rubik’s cube after watching this video! Thank you for simplifying the process and being a great teacher 💪🥂,1
"Fantastic tutorial! Much better than the others I watched. It's not lengthy and simply explained. Time frames are much appreciated. The only thing I did not enjoy in the tutorial is the last layer part bc the algorithm was not taught in the intro and I messed it up due to the lack of practice. On a side note, I liked when you voiced the algorithm sequence not just showed.",1

Thanky bro,1
Thanks I'm gonna inpress my friends now😃,1
Thank you this is working ❤️,1
"Congratulations!!!
U just solves a already soved cube!
*priceless*",1
It is very nice I learned it,1
Congratulations you have just solved the solved cube,1
Wow you are genius.,1
"it's either up or downHAHAHA, btw nice video.",1
"I recently got myself the ""impossible cube"" that you showed at the end there. Regular Rubik's brand and it both popped and had stickers fall off right out of the box. I believe they either don't give a shit because they're still the largest or they're incompetent.",0
I have a Rubik's cube that's almost 20 years old. I got into cubing recently and bought a MeiLong as soon as I got some disposable pennies. I always assumed that it turns this horrible at least in part because of its age. But seeing how your brand new cube turns exactly like mine now I wish I could get my hands on a new one just to see if there is any difference.,0
My friends are going to a speed cubing comp next week so they wanted to get me into it too. Currently have a broken thumb and a rubiks brand cube. My best time is 3:45.56. I learned how to solve it 3 days ago and I’m currently dreaming of how fast I can get my time up to if I had a working cube and thumb :),1
"I have only had a Rubik's cube for the entirety of my speed cubing journey. I'm finally going to get a good speed cube, but my best time on a regular cube is 40 seconds. It can be improved, I'm sure!",1
"The OG Rubik's Cube was set up to be basically ""temperamental child"" proof. Like you demonstrated, you can throw it at a wall and the wall will lose that battle - but it's also super unlikely to pop or corner-twist during normal use. Non-cubers often consider a cube ""broken"" if it's popped or corner-twisted - I remember having to rescue an expensive speedcube from the trash can because my cousin corner-twisted it.

That comes at the expense of having almost no corner-cutting ability and having a lot of friction making it hard to turn., but then again it's not meant to be their Speedcube (the Rubik's brand speedcube is still kinda terrible though, but for different reasons).",0
"I have had a Rubix's cube for about 6 years now, and in all that time it has never popped. I am not much of a speedcuber but I average at around 40 seconds on that cube, and I know about 10 algorithms. It has got a couple of scratches but it still works like a charm. Now I am going more into speedcubing and i am considering buying a magnetic speedcube.",1
Love how you make videos for non-cubers too! I hope it will make more people into speedcubing<3,1
I forgot to say! I wait about a minute or two and then my coffee gets ❄️ ☃️,1

"My mother used to use plastic ice cubes back in the 90s . I impressed all my friends they were colorful and cool . I also was the first vegan on my block , my friends would beg for our vegan food which was really just regular food with no cheese or meat haha . Yeah I miss those days . Haven’t tried the metal ones , nice",1
"Just a tiny minus, you cant chew on the ice",0
The one fear I have with these things is accidentally swallowing them. It's easy to forget they're not really ice cubes. I'd use a straw with these 100% of the time.,0
"I remember going to a friends house and seeing these but the plastic version, and I thought they were real so I was there trying to bite through their plastic ice cubes while my friend just stared in shock.",0
I used to freeze a metal spoon and use it to stir my hot drinks when I was a kid. I totally recommend it if you just want to chill it and be done,1
"How To Solve the Rubik's Cube FASTER ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmeleO65BHc

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE COMMENTING.

I try to reply often, but ""I don't get step X"" or ""it doesn't work"" is too unspecific and I can't help unless I know exactly what problem you have.


*MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE 4 MOVES*
1:52 has the 4 moves, and you have to be able to do this to understand what ""4 moves"" means when I use it again later on.

*COMMON FIRST LAYER PROBLEMS*
Step 1 & 2. If the side colors of the cross or first layer don't line up the way I showed it in the video, then you need to redo it. Pay attention to ALL of the colors on one piece, and don't just pick white pieces randomly. I talk about this in the video, how I'm trying to match the other colors of the white piece (like white/orange etc.)

*TAKING PIECES OUT OF THE SECOND LAYER*
Step 3. At 5:33 I say ""you should already know how to do this"". I admit this is unclear. You should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer. If this does not make sense, watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment.

*COMMON TOP LAYER PROBLEMS*
Step 4. If you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.
Step 5. There should be no problems here.
Step 6. If you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.
Step 7. Finish the 4 moves (don't stop at 3) every time. Turn the bottom (don't rotate the whole cube) to get the next piece. If it STILL does not work, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.

""Why do I need to reassemble the cube?""
Randomly assembling the cube only has a 1/12 chance of being solvable. If you've ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces, then that can be the problem. If stickers have been switched, you will have to switch them back.

"“Learn the rubix cube in 10 min!”

*3 hours of going back 10 seconds later*

Edit: I’d just like to announce that I have done the “impossible” and solved the cube. If someone such as myself can then I’m more than hopeful whoever reads this is capable of doing the same.",1
"This actually worked really well for me! The first time I tried it it took me awhile but I got to the last step, then messed it up. But, I realized it was still partially solved somehow, except the yellow was the one that was solved and the white was broken up. I just redid the last few steps with the cube upside-down (yellow on the bottom and white on the top) and it worked! Thanks for this wonderful tutorial, this was my first time solving a Rubik's cube!!",1
"This is clearly an old video, but Lemme say, I've been watching this video everyday for the last week or two and I can finally solve the cube without watching. I'ts been a long waiting bucket list thing to solve this without help and i got it! Thanks J Perm, loved the video and your content.",1
I love this tutorial. It's pretty easy to follow. Thank you!!,1
Thanks man! Even tho I never would have got this on my own it was still super satisfying to solve one for the first time 👍,1
Nothing hurts more than being on the last step and then messing up the algorithm,0
"Took me couple hours, but I did it thanks to this guide! Appreciate it 👍",1
"Thanks you so much for this video.
Solved my first cube today with your help 💙",1
Thank you! I am now part of the small percentage of people to completely solve a Rubik's cube! Couldn't have done it without this video.,1
This song hit different when you actually having a good day,1
The idea of a song about having a plain old good day from a genre that usually produces music about death and the lowest points of life… it’s really something to cherish.,1
"This song is so reassuring in a strange way. It's so comfortable to listen, like a good'ol friend you're happy is around.",1
Nostalgia pura 🇧🇷❤,1
This song is the how the last day of school feels like.,1

I love when Simon goes speechless with those expressions.,1

"You may never see this comment but if you do I just want to say thank you and all the other YouTube cubers for inspiring me to become a cuber and I found my love for cubing I learned to solve 2x2 to 5x5, the Rubik impossible, and this very morning I got my first sub minute on my 3x3 at solve time of 56 seconds and next week I be taking on the 3x3 mirror cube and I'm so grateful to the cubing community who is nothing but kind and supportive, I can't wait to see what the cubing community has next in store for me and it's been nearly 3 months since i began my cubing hobby and I wish you, jperm, Z3 cubing all the best and every other cubing YouTuber I hope to some day be able to become a speed cuber and explore more cubes but thanks for inspiring me and bringing such amazing content to YouTube all the best wishes to such kind people like you and all fellow cuber YouTubers I truly found what I'm good at and what I love to do.",1
I think that this is certainly a cube needed now. It brings to fun things together that everyone loves and I'm sure it is sooo amazing to have.,1

mark saying SOUUPEEER CUUBEES makes me laugh every time.,1
LOL just a day ago you say the Rossolimo is a bad opening and the best chess engine plays it. Goes to show how bad you are at chess and how ENORMOUS the difference is.,0
"Stockfish crushes itself, then analyzes its mistakes. What a gigachad.",0
"I personally love watching Stockfish, Magnus, Leela and any other chess engines at your channel!",1
17:22 : stockfish 15 awarding stockfish 15 a brilliant move be like : yes incredible i definitely  would not have seen it,1
"Levy, on TCEC (Top Chess Engine Championship) there were some engine games with Stockfish, Leela, Komodo, etc. where they played double Fischer random chess (DFRC). Essentially the pieces are randomized for both sides. The games were extremely fascinating, and often mind boggling. You should check them out (they are in the archive for S22 on DFRC I think)",1
Please keep these engine games coming Levy! (Like more from TCEC). Engine games are always so fascinating because of how high level they are.,1

Magnus playing in Titled Tuesday and Speed Chess Championship?! LETSS GOOOOOOOO,1
"The first thing I thought when this video began was that Magnus would probably be playing in the SCC again, damn I’m excited",1
"This is exciting! Apart from TT and SCC, theres a new Global World Championship. Too bad the RCC just finished, imagine seeing Magnus play every weekend against other strong players",1
Yooooooo what???!!! Always felt such a hole in the chess world with Magnus not participating much in the big chesscom events just because of his other tie ups. This is amazing!,1
"So we will see Magnus in SCC and some title Tuesdays, now that's a great news. 
Looking forward to see more Magnus vs Hikaru.",1
It'll be cool to see the Magnus bots alongside the other top player bots on the site or even in a special area/app.,1
Magnus is a pure business man 🔥🔥🔥,1
Hikaru: 'I'm very excited to abandon internet chess and go for classical tournaments again!',1
"its never about who bring Magnus or Hikaru , at least for me its about free analysis and quicker and lighter website . so i will always go with LICHESS",1
Hikaru himself is proof of why online chess is so important to grow the game lol. Kinda explains itself,1
"I think they are upset from magnus because he is not defending his world championship title because of which they will suffer revenue losses, less people will see ding vs nepo compared to magnus vs nepo. Less ads, less sponsorship, less online viewership etc.",0
"Hikaru continually having Magnus' back and showing him great respect is why, despite his flaws, I am still a Hikaru fan.",1
"I prefer esports chess. It looks cooler, more comfortable for the players, and they can move faster.",1
"Fair criticisms on both sides, however “online” chess played while 6ft away from your opponent is just ridiculous",0
The monsterous power of the bishop pair demonstrated with elegant moves and amazing game 👏🏼,1
"amazing attacking game! I thought once Grieve lost the exchange it would be a slow conversion for white, but that bishop pair was really sick. I love it whenever I get a bishop fortified by a pawn behind it so deep into the position .. it's like a thorn in the opponent's play.. easily worth an exchange..",1
Hopefully they don't ruin Chessable is the only good product that PlayMagnus has.,1
"Magnus owns 8,5% of Play Magnus. The bid is NOK 800m, so he gets NOK 68m. Equivalant to approx USD 7 million. Not bad 🙂",1

Ivan Sokolov vs Tiger Hillarp Persson
1997, Koge open, Denmark.
A wild and beautiful tactical game involving queen sacrifice and an awesome mating net. Definitely deserves a video. Do check it out!",1
"That really is an amazing game! White material advantage, blacks ruined structure, but the bishop pair and a long king walk to finish a great game with promotions on both sides and a queen sac.",1
"Objectively, the Bongcloud opening must be the most horrendous of options. However, at the same time, it is Hikaru's trademark. Bongcloud is beyond good and evil.",0
Bong cloud has one variation super easy to learn and surprises the opponent. Has to be the top 3 openings,1
"Just wanna point out something interesting: 12:28 the Alapin variation of the Sicilian Defence with c3 and d4 is the EXACT reverse of the main line variation of the English Opening with c6-d5. Both of them are bad for the one playing against them. Please, LISTEN to this man and take some of his advice to heart.",0
My man Levy just had MVL on his podcast then takes a massive dump on all of MVLs openings for black,0
Accepting the Queen's Gambit still remains to be my most traumatic experience in chess. I remember innocently grabbing that pawn and immediately regretting playing chess.,0
QGA player here. I kept running into literally the exact problems you listed in that section of the video. Recently I tried the Benko Gambit in one game to see how well it would do; had a completely dominant position after like 12 moves.  Excellent video as always. Keep it up!,1

"Chess is not only a game
It's Emotion🥰",1
This is brilliantly done - congrats :),1
"I'm beginning to understand chess is really like an ocean in complexity. There's place of brashness, boldness, creativity, fear, light touch, nimbleness, anger, bluffs. It is a beautiful game, rich with stunningly creative ideas and tactics. It has stood the test of time because each generation realizes in greater depth than the previous one, how many more things are possible in a game, how far ahead can pieces support each other, how deep and far-seeing ideas can be, and how rich a battlefield it is to display the full range of human cleverness and emotions.",1
"holy guacamole that was amazing. easily one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. PLEASE do more about chrss history. It's what the chess community needs to realize this game isn't just Magnus and supercomputers finding the best moves, but actual styles of play and players that for so long determined the game",1
"Chess clock brief history would be good to have been included in this documentary. How would one classify classical chess against rapid chess without clock? Nevertheless, this is such a good film. Finally, a chess film that has filled the void!",1
"This is so wonderfully made :) 
Hope this could become a series and will include the history of the FIDE, openings, schools of thought, international tournaments, ratings, title etc. Thanks again!",1
"Chess is, and forever will be, a timeless endearing game that will forever captivate the human mind. Long may it reign in thousands of years to come!",1
Such a fascinating game and really the only game I have ever gotten so interested in. The ELO system is inspiring because it gives you a goal,1
This is amazing! *I love documentaries and Chess. And they came together on my birthday.* Lucky me 😳🤯🙌🥳,1
"this is by no means a history of chess, just a history of chess world champions. there is a lot more that is more general and more interesting than who exactly beat whom in how many games",1

Someone is inevitably going to make a playable online Chess 2 and I cannot wait,1
I feel like this would legitimately be a fun variation on chess.,1
"i love this new update, it implements a rework for basically every card and a new middle piece a jail system which is very cool and adds incetives to protect and keep alive the monkey since he can save the king, giving him a great passive buff also the fish queens that even now are fake is still a great advantage to have and i personally like more that way and the new rook with his flying abilities making a great way to protect other pieces and more gameplay variety and finally a little edit to the color of the chess board who i agree the reasoning for, tho is probably harder to get a blueish board than a black and white one but is not a big issue and after mentioning all of that i will give to this update a 14/10, amazing work",1

I recently finished watching the queens gambit on Netflix and It's made me want to re enter the chess world.

That’s how you shouldn’t behave in a chess game. Black just plays intolerant and aggressively touches on the clock. I hate that,0

Congratulations again to David Howell! 🙂👍,1
David deserves a gold metal for his commentary as well,1
Anish Giri does love studying chess theory so the prospect that he might still be in opening preparation in game 2 (1:44:12) does not surprise me that much,1
"I followed the Olympiad and was floored by David's performance.  There were over 180 teams, each with around 5 players,  so there must have been  800-900 (if not more) players in the Open division.  Not one of them played more successfully than David Howell.  Moreover, his efforts went a long way towards giving England a top 15 finish.   Congratulations David Howell.  I was very happy for you.",1
Would love to see Judit Polgar & David Howell commenting. That would be great!,1
BTW:  I also saw Jovanka on camera once while she was playing in the Olympiad.  It was good to see her compete for her country (England) as well.,1

"Thank you for another enjoyable recap. You seem moderately exhausted and mildly disheartened, but the fact of the matter is you kept it close against an experienced ~2600 GM. That bodes well for the future if you decide to make a harder push for GM at some point. Good luck in your remaining rounds!",1
"I got a stalemate trap over the board once. It was against a 1700 rated player and he was living on a +30 increment, it was a little more elaborate than your one, I had to sacrifice the queen but he had no way to stop it, and I got so excited I lost the ability to speak   for the next 30 min and I was just thinking about you all the time, so thank you for that 1/2 point, Eric",1

My dad tried to teach me, but that mostly involved a lot of yelling, swearing, and tears.

Thankyou so much.",1
Finally a video that has explained the concept of chess PROPERLY for beginners. I have tried to learn for years and could not find anyone who had the ability to explain this to me. Thank you so much GothamChess 🌞,1
"I haven't played for years...needed a refresher. Thank you Levi, for a very informative and entertaining instructional video. You are a natural and easy-going teacher /entertainer. Hello from Australia!",1
You have an awesome way of keeping a total newbie engaged and not feeling totally lost! Thank you! Looking forward to getting started.,1
"Very helpful! I learned how the pieces moved decades ago as a kid, but I never learned concepts like piece vision, protecting pieces, tactics vs strategies, etc. I taught myself a bit of these through playing, but I have many holes in my understanding.",1
"I have huge anxiety, Starting to play with other people, started off marking huge mistakes, but I'm making fewer mistakes and learning what to do instead of what I did start off,  really improved !",1
"I’ve always loved chess even since I was a kid but I always found it too hard to remember the moves and rules when I was younger but being older now I’ve rediscovered how much I love it and this video really helped me get back into the swing of things and was also really informative, I’ve subscribed and I’ll be checking out your other videos to help me along the way
Thank you :)",1
"I used to play chess with my uncles when I was a kid, recently got back into it with my little brother and this video has been very helpful in refreshing my memory",1
That boi 7 snapped on this bih. He definitely done stepped it up a level,1
Stumbled on to this video by mistake. Never heard of this guy but I’m liking the flow 🎤. Much success to you my guy 🥂,1
I’m playing this shit 1000 times already this boy is str8 smoke …. 💯,0
Trap n yella punching the air on that drizzy bar 🔥🔥🔥🔥this song snappin,1
"This MF Song is gonna stay on repeat,  LONG LIVE OSAMA 👍👈",1
Much ❤ 7 you killed it BIG HOMIE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎶🎵🎶🎤🦍❤...the laugh at the end gets me every time I can't help but laugh too 🤣,1
Hell yeah coming with that heat 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,1
"The similarity between lichess and sahil is they stand out between other platforms and also have less subscriber and low net worth  ,perfectly made for each other",1
"Love the commentary from Leko, great to have Lawrence with him, they make a great pair. Would love to see Leko on the main stream.",1
Wow Peter really had tears for pragg after the heartbreak of a game for him @4:55:00 ! Amazing how chess players can feel each other's  pain ♥️..And everyone does like Pragg..,1
"Great to see Lawrence back, and he seems new and improved.  Well maybe not new, but improved.",1
Peter Leko is a very sweet guy in the way he speaks 👍,1
"I just don't think Magnus takes chess very seriously anymore.  And that's his right.  We're still thrilled to have him, distracted.  Still very entertaining and insightful, still a great contributor to the chess world.",1
Peter Leko ❤️.  4:54:58 😥....Pragyanantha good effort man 👍,1
Magzy unstoppable,1
"Would it be possible to make sure that the player's board + eval bar is never removed from the screen? There's a lot of times where we're showing the analysis board, and the 4 faces of the players/commentators, and that's terrible for me because I can't see what's happening in the real game, what the current eval is, and do my own thoughts. Plus there's really no need to see all 4 faces and not see the board",0
"Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with *WTRADE INSPECTS* insights and charts. They been one step ahead of other analysis..",0
"That's why Magnus really wanted to face a new generation player in the WCC since he knew they had more chances than the players of his generation. It's just like other tournaments, even if Magnus loses some games, he still won the tournament. Looking forward to Praggnanandha, an amazing performance for him.",1
Magnus Carlsen is THE GOAT! Congrats to Pragg...i'm sure he will be the new world champion,1
"So happy for Pragg!!! 😀😀😀 I was thinking ""push your pawns Pragg at the end game, please push your pawns!"" And when he finally started doing that he had much better winning chances. Well done!",1
"Pragg continuing to be the comeback king!! Amazing play, he made this tournament extremely exciting, was just glued to all his games. And Magnus also played really well at the start but I lost respect for him towards the end when in the interviews he just kept making excuses for his defeats and tried to discredit pragg completely. He couldn't even look at pragg for even a second as he was speaking and looked so disinterested. The least you could do even if u dont congratulate him or admit he played well is acknowledge him and he couldnt even do that which is a shame because Magnus has carried himself so well in the past and praised pragg before so it's not that he cant but simply he couldnt accept the defeats today which is so disappointing from a professional player like him, rlly left a bitter taste but I'm soo happy for pragg that even if he didnt win the tournament, he certainly showed hes a force to be reckoned with and won our hearts with his persistence which was just so inspiring.",1
"Firouzja and Pragganandhaa are both playing very well at this age, the future is in the hands of these two young men. But I can't say which one",1
"Pragg; I was lucky today to win the 4th game.
Magnus: I did not have good sleep yesterday. 
Lol",1
Pragg.. what a champ!!! So young yet so talented. The next Anand for sure.,1
"Aronian has such a great attitude towards the game of chess.
Such a gentleman.",1
"Levon Aronian is by far my favourite player - excellent att chess of course, but a really nice and likeable person too.",1
I wish you guys would cover more than just one game per round! switch around and explore several games!,1
"It looked like Aronian was just exhausted in Game 4 and wanted to be done with it, else those last moves with so much time don't make much sense for a player of his quality.",0
"chess needs more funding ,, seriously ,, the best of the minds are fighting it out ,, there should be more prize money for each of them ,,",1
Pragg🔥🔥,1
Pragg is amazing player..even aronian smile when he lost to pragg and magnus also smile when he lost that final game to pragg..it is show that you are great player if opponent smile when they lost to you,1
Leko is just the best asset of chess24 :D what a machine,1
"Pragg the mountain GOAT! The world is awakening to Tamil's mental prowness. Equal to the best and 2,nd to none. Let the chess speak for itself .You ain't seen nothing yet !!!",1
"Winning a high level tournament while chilling and enjoying a comedy podcast, magnus seems to have found the right combination of work+chill.",1
Magnus the 🐐 wins another event. The man just can’t stop winning one event after another!!,1
Great event!,1
You can’t rlly blame him he missed a mate in 4 with 10 seconds left,0
"MAGNUS is the biggest heart of chess player. He delibrately lost himself at the final. He won the tournament and won everything. Actually the true winner is someone who gives the winning to those who more needed. Magnus did and always does. TAKING KNIGHT E6, ARE YOU KIDDING?.",1
bring wesley back and give a shot to raunak! better than pragg. the next vishy!,1
And magnus introduced the new laughing gambit....but tbh magnus such a beast even he blunders somewhere he'll find all good moves after and manages to hold....prag too well played n not pushed too much....GG❤️,1
"Agad humour is why we love this channel. 
The tongue in cheek comment in timestamps, the knight making fancy moves to pick up the pawn, the inside joke on the b4 square.... 
Man, it makes my day ❤️",1
Pragg and Carlsen are making the best games in the whole tournament!,1
"I'm glad the timestamps have returned! I typically jump to the first timestamp given it is typically where the game starts. So I still heard what you said, Antonio. I see you :p",1
"I LOVE ANTONIO'S ""PHILOSOPHY"" MOMENTS, LIKE THIS ONE ABOUT THE ""TIME STEMP PEOPLE"", WHO WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT HE HAS SAID!",1
"WOAH! So many double takes throughout this match. Every time I glanced away, Magnus slipped out of another hairy situation. Magnus is a magician 🪄 🎩",1
"The main reason I like Alex is because she is genuinely interested in people and pays attention to them when they speak, tell stories, etc. Very rare nowadays IMO.",1
Trash Talker snatched defeat from the jaws of victory...,0
What a turnaround!  Plus: this was a particularly good video because she sort of interviewed him about his life's experience with chess!  So it's a trash talk game....with an interview!  Alex is juggling three things during this video!  Liked the written commentary tips as well.,1
"Man he messed that one up so, so bad. Had a free rook and totally threw his advantage right in the eternal bowels of fire hell.",0
"Love how you tell him he is not hitting the clock right, could waste your time while he is making a move, and he won’t change, so you start hitting the clock twice two. Too funny.",0
"""I was born as an orphan"", lost me right at the start 😆",0
After that moment when he started talking shit into the camera he fell apart lol. Classic overconfidence right there.,0
"Amazing comeback! I really tought that taking the rook still will give him a win but in the end  that didnt help and wow really nice to see that you didnt collapse to time pressure, that's for sure inspiring Great Gaming from both :D",1
Great game Alexandra! Love the IRL chess streams and tournaments. Keep up the good work!,1
"That ""fake training"" tip has given me an epiphany about everything I do in life. Thank you Levy.",1
"""Local sight"" is a common mistake (at least for me at fast time controls). You focus your attention on a specific area of the board and just forget that (far beyond) a long range piece is defending a square you judge unprotected.",0
Dude the fake training tip really does apply to everything. I’ve been practicing life drawing every day but just mindlessly putting marks on paper without internalizing new concepts. No wonder why I haven’t improved in quite a while. Thanks for opening my eyes Gotham!,0
"I’ve started late in life at 58, and I’ve been paying for a year now. I decided to get better after I got so angry during lock down playing with my husband, that I felt sooo silly. Then Watching your videos, over and over made a big difference and In the last couple of months I’ve had some pretty amazing breakthrough! So thank you!",1
"This was more than a chess lesson.  This was a life lesson.  Thank you, Levy!",1
"This video is EXACTLY what the doctor ordered for me. I am guilty of ALL of these. I'm overly ""fake trained"" on puzzles, with an overconfidence and overinflated (2000-2100) puzzle rating. But in online games, I'm getting my ass handed to me by 1200 players, because of ALL these mistakes!!! Time to do a major reset! I made a post it cheat sheet on these 7 mistakes and will keep it in front of me as I play future online games. Time to get back to completing all the opening courses I have on Chessable! Thanks Levi!",0
"She really said, “Good thing my sister is not here” 😂😂😂 the dad said “She’ll lose too” 😂💀 what a savage",0
"I lost in four moves to my 5 year old son  once. I felt very humbled, and a bit foolish. He was beaming with triumph at having defeated his dad at chess.",1
"Dear Andrea, I was thoroughly impressed by your welcoming, warm attitude and your gracious and warm attitude when you lost. I think that the way you played and engaged young Kai will stay with him for the rest of his life. You may not be (at this time) the number one chess player in the world, but I think you're doing something far more important: you're winning the hearts of these children and that is a gift that will stay with them for life. Thank you for sharing.",1
"I love how they just had fun and kept smiling.

I do wonder how well they would have done if not multitasking",1
"What a wonderful  young lady you are to work with children! And , a big CONGRATULATIONS to the young man! He was SO happy  while playing.",1
"I still remember the last chess tournament I played in.  I competed against 9 opponents at the same time, while blindfolded.   Lost every game!
Gotta have goals!",0
"This is just a simple, respectful game of chess and I love it. That kid is great, I support him!",1
That was a perfect show of great sportsmanship hats off to both the players,1
"This is just a simple, respectful game of chess and I love it. That kid is great, I support him!",1
"Damn bro.. prag is goddamn great at endgame 🔥.. he doesn't do a single mistake even if he is low on time.. 
Magnus narrowly escaped 😅..
But anyway, 2 great days for him..",1
"so nice that at the end Levon and Jan walked together to talk to Svene. Great sportsmanship, something Hans should learn from",1
"I said it a million times and I will always do, David Howel is the most under-rated chess player in the whole world. The sharpness of this guy and the speed he spots the perfect moves is not something you can ignore. Also I watch this show because of David I can always check the matches results anywhere but I always come here just to watch David and Simon my favorite 2 chess players.",1
"Daved , Jovanka , Kaja , Simon you are the best , thank you , you made me love chess ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌺🌺🌷🌷🌷",1
"A huge CONGRATS David, well done!! cheers kev",1
"I am so happy for David achievement, million congratulations ❤️❤️❤️❤️",1
Congrats David!! What a legend!!,1
Great cast as always!,1
"I had the honor of speaking personally with René Letelier, and he was a true gentleman. The great thing about him is that he became an International Master without even being a professional chess player. He worked in a bank, and in his free time or vacations he played tournaments. Regarding this game, he mentioned that he just enjoyed every move that Fischer made on the board (Letelier played 3 times against Fischer, being defeated 2 times, and beating Bobby 1 time). 

Sorry my English. It's not my first language :)",1
"We love Jerry's videos. His analysis is excellent. Jerry, we hope you will review some of the games at this year's Candidates Tournament.",1
"I really liked the way the game was described. Each move was analyzed with possible options, giving the viewer opportunity to see how Fischer developed his strategy. Some commentators are too fast, too slick. This was much better.",1
"Jerry, your videos are some of the most instructive on the internet. My top 3 favorite Youtubers are you, Gotham and Daniel Naroditsky. Gotham teaches you how to understand broad, overarching concepts like a master. Daniel teaches you how to understand the fine details like a master. And you teach us how to realize what master-level thinking even looks like. Seriously. I studied tactics and positional chess for years and couldn't advance past 1200. But your Beginner to GM series totally revolutionized the way I looked at the board. I gained more in the 2 years since I watched those videos than I did in my previous 5+ years of serious chess study.",1
What a beautiful game! I’ve never seen this before. One of the many reasons Bobby Fischer may have been the greatest player ever,1
"I think I'm speaking in name of every one here when I say: we need more videos, Jerry. We love your videos.",1
"Hey, Jerry. Been watching you for more than 14 years now and I pretty much owe you my accent. Thanks for the chess analysis and English that you have taught me during this huge period of time. And I really would like to see your face while listening to you. Please keep it in your mind. You are excellent . Take care. 🙏🙏",1
I'm certainly not a good chess player. I think your narration was perfect. It gave me insights as to what the great players are thinking. It's the best chess video I've seen. Thanx.,1
"Quality over quantity. Watching your powerful, well thought analysis always shows me, you're on another level. Thanks for your effort!",1
"I was just thinking yesterday “man it’s been a while since jerry uploaded”. Always a joy to see you uploading, especially the analysis vids!",1
Massive respect to Jeffrey for sportsmanship,1
This playoff series and 2-game match format is absolutely insane! 10/10 👏👏🔥🔥,1
GGs the semi matchups are so good,1
Smells like Wesley vs Ian to me 😊,1
"Oh the broadcast of the faces are so delayed. You don’t see Hikaru reacting to his own blunder until the guy responds to the move. In real time Hikaru had the same reaction as Danya as soon as HE played the move haha. I hate when they happens, right as you let go of the piece you see why it’s bad.",0
getting gooood,1
"magnus' power is unbelievable, he even took over agadmators mind for a second and made him bongcloud",1
When Agadmator played King E2 by mistake that was the brilliancy that we hoped to see!😀,1
The way Alireza's bishop and rook coordinated to keep harassing Carlsen's queen was magical,1
"Not sure which I like more, watching Magnus win or watching him lose.  Either way, it's great to watch.",1
Magnus  has become so good... hes just trying random things  🤣 god level,1
"Since I started watching your channel the phrase ""threatens nasty discoveries"" has been lodged so deep in my mind, I will be dreaming it constantly till I die.",0
The coordination of white’s pieces in this game was beautiful.,1
And its now as of move seven that we have a completely new game...who else likes this line from Agad 😇😇,1
"Danny is 💪, great games!",1
"This is one of the best chess games I have ever watched. The other one was here too; in the same park.

Fun, friendly, relaxed, and brilliant.

Thanks Anna. You are a real champion.",1
That's my cousin. Always had a kind heart and always loved chess while we were goofing around as kids I would watch that boy read chess books and wash grown men. I'm so proud of you man.,1
"She said Danny plays an ""aggressive style"" but actually, if you look, he is quite positional. Loves the two bishops and throws in an h4 to throw off his opponent. He tries to make make very tiny advantages that eventually point at your king. I simply love his playing style!",1
Im so impressed by Danny’s ability to delay castles in both games. He seems very aware of the positional advantages that he can take by delaying.,1
"Anna, love the videos.  2 suggestions: 1) it'd be awesome if you could show the clock somehow?. Maybe a digital clock that can be synchronized to the video?  2) If you or opponent resign, a 30 second explanation of why it was ""resigns"" at the end would be awesome.  In this case, I saw your B on a5 was hanging and white's rook defending their e2 bishop.  But it's not always super easy for us to figure out.",1
Anna took two losses in a row and was laughing and having fun with a strong player. It's amazing to watch two pros go neck and neck at each other like this. Thank you so much!,1
"Other than an amazing player, Danny seems really modest and kind. I wish I was living anywhere near these kinds of Parks. I love how it's nice weather, people casually walking by and stop to spectate the game. It kind of restores my faith in this world",1
Gotta love chess…How does a random dude in the park casually crush a FM with a lifetime of training and world famous GM parents? She earns my respect for posting this!,1
Need a Danny YouTube. His play style would be really fun to watch consistently,1
"Also interesting for curious people, Pragg has been called as Grunfeld Slayer by GM Howell – as he has won 100% of his games as white against it.",1
Pragg is becoming my favorite chess player. Still love Chucky's games but pragg is putting in that work and making magic happen on the board.,1
"Prag is a Monster, I hope he will become one day WC.
I love this guy, he is a nice person and so humble.
Indians peoples can be proud of him.",1
Pragg in yesterday's interview :- I just want to play a better chess tommorow and he did play it♥️,1
Pragg vs magnus is getting the hype as they are the only players unbeaten on all rounds,1
"It's actually game 1 of the Fischer - Larsen match of 1971. I've been searching for that incredible game, thanks for the heads up on it. I remember back in the day on my Chessmaster library Yasser Seirawan described it beautifully when he said the bishop pair had two jobs, one to guard the king and two to shepherd the a pawn home. A masterclass.",1
And just a few minutes before the child has defeated Levon in the final match also. It was as awesome as this one or better than this one.,1
"Watching Eric destroy his opponents while dancing is one of the best things I have ever seen in chess!!!
You will not play alone in the final, the boys are with you!!!
Lets goooooo!!!!!",1
Eric Hansen on god mode! Go eric one of my favorite streamers.,1
eric also beat hikaru at (drunken) lawn wrestling :),1
Great job,1
Watch till the end for the twist! 😊,1
"""The computer couldn't comprehend his self-sacrificing move""

Yeah because kings can't move into check.",0
"Inventor: ""I feel bad, so we could either A) I'll pay for therapy and some extra money to help him recover. Or B) we can organize an elaborate death game that will require a whole bunch of set pieces, actors, and effects to traumatize him a different way.""

Wife: ""I like B, let's do B.""",0
"This is the 2nd part of a Japanese anthology film. First one is a horror episode, 3rd one is a comedy, and the last one I think is a romance sci-fi. Overall a great film, and it introduced me to the awesomeness of non-hollywood content since I watched it years ago. This recap makes me want to rewatch the film again. Thanks !!",1
i really loved the ending! accepting one's mistakes without hesitations is a true winner of all winners 🏆,1
I really was expecting a really messed up ending where the wife actually never loved him or something like that. Didn't expect it to be a wholesome ending. Great stuff. 😂,0
"10:22 lmao the computer couldn't understand the ""king's sacrifice"" move that GM Vidit Gujrathi made against Hikaru and self-destruct",0
"0:40 ""Grandmaster vs computer"", ""Super Blue"", ""First Player to lose a computer""

Well, that's just movie version of happened in 1997 where Grandmaster Gary Kasparov lost to Deep Blue.",0
This was absolutely priceless and brilliant !! this really made my day. Thank you ! Great narration too ! Thanks for making me laugh ! In the car as a bishop with a rook key ring. Hahahaha . I love you Japan !,1
"Great production, great coverage, and a show that is so levelled that you can watch it while you are busy doing other things. Thanks Chess 24!",1
"Liem is the opposite of Niemann : polite, smiley and composed",0
"Hans also played well, he could have gone for a draw , think he wanted to go for a win and lost. best wishes to him too.",1
@3:50:00 awkward...the interview is happening with the sponsor just when the Carlsen-Aronian game has the champion sac a queen.  LOL hard to cut away from the sponsor when that happens.  Murphy's law in action.,0
Praggananda is great,1
Omg...it just popped into my head that Anish Giri looks like Michael Jackson!!😂,1
Great,1
"Hope Hans is fine. He's a good player, it's always fun to watch his games. A bit of trash talk never harmed nobody.",1
"At this point Hans Niemann's chess has stopped speaking, now it's screaming in pain.",0
"We keep saying ""It's the Magnus effect"" (not talking about basketballs and dams here....) but would be interesting to test this. In an esport I follow, (Age of Empires 2) one player (TheViper) was so dominant for so long that a streamer (T90Official) came up with the idea of an event he called Hidden Cup where everyone's identities were hidden and only revealed at the end. Each player was given a name to play under so nobody knew who was who. Was a really interesting concept, as there were awesome games and so much speculation over who was who. They've repeated the format 4 times now, which says something about how loved it is. But with chess being an online thing now, this kind of event is very possible and I think would be fascinating. Would Magnus still win? (TheViper did, so proved that theory wrong at least for him!)",1
"""If he was winning nobody would be talking."" 
Very true words...hopefully Hans will comeback...",1
Game 4 was insane. All Praggu needed was a draw and he pulls out an untested gambit. Then sacrifices a second pawn! The chess world is changing. Doesn’t he know he’s supposed to play the Berlin and force a draw.,0
I still can’t believe he gets the privilege of playing with the best chess player in the world! Magnus sure is a lucky man,1
Magnus's reactions are hilarious. He looks genuinely shocked by some of the moves Ludwig plays.,1
I love how excited Magnus gets when Ludwig plays the move he wanted,1
Crazy that Lud is well-known enough in the chess community that he can collab with the greatest in the world.,1
"Magnus’ reaction when Ludwig does a bad move or blunder is comedy, we need more Magnus and Ludwig collars.

Edit: i hate autocorrect",0
Magnus must be so happy to play with the best chess player in the world. Happy for him,1
"Candidates Participants: I have to train the hardest I ever have to be able to play against Magnus for his title
Magnus:",0
Online chess is far inferior to normal chess. I can’t flip the board in anger.,0
"*black moves pawn to a6*
me: good move
eric: ok this is the first big blunder",0
"Chess does  not improve focus, it worsens it. Everytime I try to do something, I want to play chess so I can't focus on the task at hand",0
"Oh so cool! 
GG Eric, I was hoping to at least make you think a bit harder, but oh well ... haha.",1
"Considering how lopsided this game was, material-wise, Black held on for an amazing amount of time.",1
Not bad!,1
"Chess is so easy to learn, yet so hard to master",0
"""stalemate is a thing that rarely happens""
Me in every game I play: oh boy how wrong you are",0
The Queen's Gambit was the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the title of the video but let's be honest. I have to watch the video and play chest many times in order to learn. But this was pretty helpful. Thank you!,1
My friend is in the nationals of chess championships so he taught me chess but still this helped me a lot thanks,1
It makes me so happy to see chess getting popular.,1
"Nice inspiring chess video for the learners, THANKS @BRIGHT SIDE",1
"And he died at 64, one year for every square on the board. Poetic.",0
Spasky was arguably even more impressive by being a grandmaster of kindness.,1
I remember watching an interview with Fischer and he mentioned how during matches even the wrong lighting would throw him off. Definitely seems like he might have had sensory issues that weren’t well understood at the time.,0
"My grandfather actually played with Bobby regularly in 1956 at the West Orange Chess Club in New Jersey. They played on the same team in inter-state tournaments. I found some of my Grandpa’s old letters and it’s pretty cool. He won multiple chess championships (some amateur and some professional) in the late 40s and early 50s. He also was involved in a few professional chess clubs and magazines. He was born in 1909 and while I like to think he taught Bobby a thing or two to help him gain his immense success that year, it’s likely the 13 year old schooled my grandpa. My grandpa quit chess in 1957 to turn professional in bridge because it was better financially (chess tournaments didn’t pay well back then). Though, he probably played teenage Bobby enough to know he stood no chance in the future. If a 13 year old made a multi-time champion quit the game entirely, he must have been truly special. My grandpa could card count so I don’t think he had a problem switching to bridge, and became a national life master in bridge and had a successful career. I never got to meet him because he died before I was born (I’m only 23), I would’ve loved to ask him about Bobby. Maybe my mom knows a bit more. All I have are letters and a few chess trophies. It’s very hard to collect information from the early 50s.",1
"The light sensitivity and erratic behavior are symptoms of a person ""on the spectrum"". It is not uncommon for people like this to prefer lamps to ceiling lights as the glare is annoying to them. Lashing out comes from difficulty communicating, feeling different and knowing you are different, it is easy to believe that you are being mocked and lacking the skills to compete it is easier to flee than fight. Fishers mental health was probably not caused by chess but the pressure that came to surround him due to his success at chess. While playing he probably felt safe, knowing the rules, knowing everyone had to obey them and that he would not be mocked for some social faux pas he didn't understand or care about.",0
"My dad tried to teach me chess, I was only 10, he was 52. I picked up the moves of the pieces easily. Halfway through our first game he said “Do you have a strategy or are you just making moves at random?” I said “Making moves at random.” He boxed up the pieces and that was that. I later turned out to be a terrific poker player 😁",1
INCREDIBLY DONE ❤️,1
"Apart from the blindfold, this is the nicest levy has ever been",1
"First of all, as someone that has played chess for close to 20 years (on and off), I am impressed with the results that Michelle made in a short time. Chess is a game that you have to play for months at the very least to become good at. It takes time to recognize patterns and then feel comfortable enough playing against someone else that has also been playing for a while. You did great Michelle :)",1
"Thank you so much for reaching out early in 2021, I am so thrilled we got to start this journey and everything it became. Congratulations on a spectacular episode, cheers to us all hating chess together!",1
"I'm officially addicted to rewatching this shit over and over. I think Michelle really put her finger on the main problem with chess: because it's so much tied to our perception of intelligence, not being good enough makes you feel dumb and embarrassed rather than just treating it as another skill to learn. Once you get over this barrier in your head, it becomes fun",0
"Anna and her ""It's Castlemania!!"" had me at the edge of my seat cheering. Lovely to have someone so supportive and excited for you in your corner",1
"Fun fact: Magnus Carlsen has won TEN games at the same time while blindfolded before! However, this pales in comparison to the world record, 48 games played blindfolded at the same time, held by Grandmaster Timur Gareyev.",1
Forgot to mention british people are extremely good at chess cuz their queen is immortal,1
Chess is one of those games where you can prove you’re smarter in every way just by winning,1
"as someone who used to really be into chess, I can indeed validate that everything said in this video is true.",1
Thanks James. Really informative for an older beginner like me (I'm 59). I always fail because the young players are so fast at assessing positions and adapting. Now I can have a system - hopefully I'll feel less disoriented 😂.,1
Would love to see you playing a game live preferably a rapid game at 15-20mins time control and  how you yourself use these aspects to analyse- evaluate a positions as the game goes on. I think that would be great viewing.,1
"Dear Friend, I'd like to congratulate you on starting this kind of educational videos. I've watched hundreds of your analysis. they're brilliant. I'm sorry don't know your name. It'd be great if you please introduce yourself briefly in the next video. thanks again and wishing you all the best.",1
This is the type of stuff that will make you grow because a lot of people are casual non club players but love chess and are always willing to learn,1
"Material, squares, pawns, initiative, development, space, minor piece, king safety ... Got It ... excellent toolkit. How could you define activity ? Is activity an umbrella concept for Initiative + space + development + minor pieces ??? Very nice new format, digging up old wisdom in chess books. Thanks a lot!",1
I'm getting better but analyzing who's better but converting that advantage of pieces or space into a win is still a big challenge.,1
Enjoying the new direction - my tattoo didn’t need any more new prodigies! 🤣👍🏽,1
Good stuff,1
Good job,1
Thank you sir for your wonderful explanation,1
"1 of the best by alekhine,  sir a match where alekhine with black exchanged queens in style + sac of 2 rooks for rebirth of his queen,  0-1 outstanding game",1
"very nice game sir , bishop G6 is game changing move.",1
Best opening frome white I ever seen!,1
Thank you so much gor wonderfull game,1
Nice vintage game sir thx 🙏🙏🙏🙏,1
Very nice game 👍,1
"I actually prefer the pre-recorded events, the cinematography and editing are WICKED AWESOME!",1
I’d love to get the 14 pro. It’d be a ni e upgrade from my 11. But it’s sooo expensive.,1
I haven't had a new iphone for a few years. I'm very hyped to see what has changed.,1
"Moving over to iOS from Android in September, looking at picking up the iPhone 14 Pro Max if I can get a great deal. At a later date I'm looking at adding Airpods Pro 1 or 2. Was going to stick with Android, but due to the Samsung S22 Ultra being shipped with the Exynos Chip and throttling back performance in the UK it's led me to switching to an Iphone.",1
Planning on upgrading from a XR but having no USB-C leaves a sour taste on my mouth,0
Im really looking forward to getting the smaller 6.1 inch iPhone 14 Pro Graphite 512GB📱😎,1
Apple Watch Pro gonna my first apple watch. Wanted apple for a long time to take the watch to the extreme and finally its happening.,1
"Don't ask me how I posted this 3 hours before the official Apple announcement. I am not a wizard, I do not own a time machine. Please disregard all rumors saying I own a time machine.",0
"Wow 2 weeks?!😳 Time is flying by fast! 
Great work as always Greg🙏🏻 Hope to finally upgrade. 
Still wish for a pink color in the Pros lol",1
"Love the content, Greg. Keep it up.",1
"Have updated every year but not this year……..keeping the mini because it’s the perfect size, easy in/out of pocket, one handed for nearly every feature",1
Finally !!! The front facing camera moving to the horizontal position. 👏 Now if only they would carry this over to the pro models. That’s when I would buy one as I do zoom and teams calls and the current iPad setup is totally frustrating.,0
This is crazy! Finally a new event! Oh yeah! I hope for the iPad 10th gen and of course iPhone 14!!! I need to make a video about it on my channel too.,1
"I used to own a Time Machine (well, actually a Time Capsule) but the drive in it failed. I would love to see Apple bring back a modern version of that device. The Pro watch is attractive (I’m still rocking a 6) and forget about *any* new iPhone until they have USB-C/Thunderbolt 4.",1
Will wait one more year for the universal connectivity of USB-C and the better battery life and speed of the 3nm processor.,1
"I'm buying iPhone 14 Pro Max and Apple watch 8 plus newest Airpods Pro, been saving ages! Cheers dude. Won't the Pro Max come with 16 out of the box though? 👍🏻🙂🇬🇧",1
Thanks for the informative video! I have an iPhone 13 Pro and probably gonna stick with it for maybe 3-4 years 👍,1
LET'S GO IT'S SATELLITE TIME BABY 🛰🛰🛰,1
My day instantly gets better whenever Sam uploads!! I can't wsit for this event!!! I hope we get the satellite connectivity feature!!! The new prices are terrifying 😰,1
"It seems way more likely to me that the invite is actually referring to astrophotography. The iPhone has improved a LOT in the last few years at low-light photography, especially if you're using a tripod. Plus, if there's going to be a 48mp camera sensor, that'll be amazingly helpful for nighttime shots. I'm about as confident about that as Sam is about it being satellite connectivity 😂",1
"I'll be upgrading to the iPhone 14 Pro Max after using an 8 Plus for five years, so I imagine I'll really feel that upgrade. Stoked!",1
I seriously hope Ian and Luke is on the Genius Bar Podcast this week.,1
"Astrophotography? Can it finally take pictures of the moon, like my DSLR? I love your channel nd podcast and can't wait for the 14 pro max!",1
I’m honestly waiting for the new iPad Pro’s to drop.. Might make the M1 pros available for cheaper (refurbished or otherwise)! Heck it may make the 2018 ones even cheaper.,1
"seeing how things are lately coming out with Apple, I've been very excited to see what comes out. Great coverage and updates as always, Sam! LOL 4:09 Luke just so casual in the background 😄",1
I so hope they drop the AirPods Pro 2 at this event. That’s all I’m interested in at the minute.,1
"You don’t know how happy I am to see you back John!
Keep doing what you do!!",1
"Don't scare us like that, Jon!  I'm glad you're back in front of the camera!",1
"Order of event prediction:

1) AirPods Pro 2 
2) Apple Watch: Regular, SE then Pro, probably with some new fitness related service as well
3) iPhone 14 series: Regular then Pros",1
I missed FPT :( welcome back jon 😄,1
"Here's my current prediction for this event:

Intro : what Apple had achieved this year compared to other years.

New Apple tv plus subscription service 

Updated iPad 

 AirPod Pros 2

 Apple Watch: Regular, SE then Pro, probably with a new fitness service.

iPhone 14 series: Regular then Pros",1
"My prediction for that event will be 
They will start off with the the new Software and the new chip 
Then move on to the Apple watches 
And after they last thing will be all about the iPhone and of course the iPhone 14 pro and pro max. With all the new functions. 
Well that’s my predictions. Hope to with that iPhone but still best of luck to every one 🙏🏽",1

3. Airpods Pros 2
4. Apple Watch 8, then rugged/pro edition
5. Iphone 14 regular, then pros",1
Who's excited for September 7th!?,1
When it comes to Apple the key to the hints they give is not to overthink it and I’m pretty sure this is related to the newer bigger camera that’s gonna be on the phones that will take beautiful pictures of the night sky. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about Apple in the past 10 years is that they aren’t that deep.,1
"It’s going to be sooo awesome this year and I can’t wait for all the fun we’re gonna have in the livestream! 😃
I really hope the iPhone 14 Pro’s coming purple. It’s my first time not wanting to buy the space gray 📱",1
"It’s be great if they gave us the feature to watch a video in one screen while watching on a live show to start in another screen top and bottom. 

Also the ability to add covers to the multi app clusters to make the screen look cleaner.

The ability to to swipe conversations to the side like Picture in Picture while doin other things instead of having to go back and forth between apps.",1
"I'm excited to see what Apple announces at the event! I'm really hoping for a camera with more than 12 megapixels, I think it would be a game changer for sure especially for photographers like me, all in all I'm excited for the event.",1
"I am very excited! I do believe it is focused on iPhone and Apple Watch along with maybe some new AirPod Pro models. The iPad release along with a new Mac pro computer will come in October. It will be strange getting iOS watchOS and tvOS updates but no iPad out West on the same day. It is called confusion. Apple needs to work on consistency and not just jumping around like they decided to do if that is what will happen. I’d like Apple because of their consistency and being able to keep things in the same time frame. Hopefully I was 16 and watchOS along with tvOS will be released on Monday, September 12 which is a scheduled day off for me from work. I do not like getting updates while I am at work because it will take time to install them. I did watch YouTube video from a different channel and I replied to the comments about compatibility for next year and he thought that iPhone 8 would not be compatible with iOS 17 in 2023. Do you think this is true? If so, should my parents who have iPhone 8 models should upgrade this year or wait until before I was 17 comes out? Out? I did tell them about the iPhone SE third-generation because neither one seems interested in upgrading to my iPhone 12 or getting one with face ID themselves.",1
I usually switch back and forth yearly between apple and android as I like both (fanboy of neither) but apple is hitting a peak and really not innovating much anymore. I’m just going to switch from the 13 pro max to the S22 Ultra. As I said I love both but I’m not seeing any reasons to upgrade with apple this year. If the 15 is a game changer it will be right up my yearly cycle routine switch between both 👌🏻,1
"Thank you so much Brandon,I love your entertaining and informative videos!!.I really appreciate your efforts and dedication!!.You are so awesome and amazing!!.I can’t wait for the iPhone 14s and iOS 16!!.Keep up your great efforts Brandon!.",1
"Here’s an 💡:

What if Apple made an iPhone Mini 2, starting around $1099with three cameras, no notch, , but have it the size of the current 13 mini? Small but super powerful, and i know a bunch of people would buy it. 

Cmon mini gang, where yall at?",1
The thing I am most interested in is seeing how Apple will sell the 14 with a straight face,1
AirPods without stems would loose their character,0
"I truly appreciate your videos. Because of you, I’ve kept my XsMax and my Apple Watch 5. I don’t see the need to upgrade until next year if Apple go to the USBC.",1
Good news with keeping the stem. I always wondered how they could pull a stem removal off without killing usability. I mean how the hell should you press a button when this thing is turning 180° and then buttons are on the inside.,0
"iPhone 14 will be the most amazing incredible outrageous thing anyone has seen anywhere in all of time and even beyond time
It will run IOS 15, come in many colors, take great photos and videos, will be able to charge on a little black plate on a table, extreme perfect infinite edit whenever and always multitask, exquisitely play very special music and movies, and like the last 3 generations will be enable you to multi task at lightning speed but perhaps a little faster but you will not be able to notice since the last one was so fast 
It will be pure magic 🪄",1
I am ready for September 7! Hopefully iOS 16 and watchOS now will come out on Monday the 12th. That would be a good release date. I find it funny that iPadOS will be delayed a month. That is very strange. It seems like Apple would just wait until stage manager got fixed and release it with a subsequent update like iPadOS 16.1 or 16.0.1.,1
On the beta ios 16 there is a battery indicator feature in battery settings it is automatically set so default to only show in low power mode instead of the bar decreasing it will always show you your battery 👍,1
"Mich interessiert diese mal vor allem das technische Innere der iPhones. Beim MacBook Air M2 hat Apple beim kleinsten Speicher lediglich einen einzelnen Baustein verbaut und die Geräte sind deshalb angeblich langsam. Falls diese Technik auch bei den iPhones verbaut wird bin ich schon gespannt was drinnen ist.
Und zum iPhone Mini:
Ich könnte mir vorstellen, dass dieses Gerät in naher Zukunft als iPhone SE 4(2024) oder SE 5(2026) zurückkommt.
😎🍎😈🎸🤘",1
"you know what is sad, when you cant trust to even update your phone cause how bad the corruption is.",0
"This presents a problem . 
Notice this mysterious hacker would try to target everyday people, instead of the powers that be.",0
These issues are not growing pains! It's risky business.,0
That’s why we all know if you update your phone when the new phones are about to come out it kills your battery messes with your old one so you were forced to buy a new one,0
I hate how these companies’ need to innovate “for” us always creates problems and bloated operating systems—for us. Microsoft is worse.,0
My iPhone auto updated last night and when i looked at my notifications this morning i had a notification telling me there has been an apple data leak and they recommend changing all my current passwords now this! Smh 🤦🏽,0

"I know I’m in the minority, but I love my 13 Mini, will be keeping that until it can’t go anymore, or some huge leap in tech comes. Also, got a titanium Apple Watch 7 at launch and will be keeping that until we get a HUGE leap in battery tech.",1
I have an iPhone 11 pro that I'm completely happy with.  I'm STILL impressed by the cameras on it... beautiful pictures and video.  Is there ANY compelling reason for me to upgrade to the 14?  Otherwise I'll wait until the 15 with USB-C.,1
I'll upgrade when they finally put USB-C on next year's iPhone.,1
"Whoever's reading this, i pray that whatever you're going through gets better and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen",1
"Apple is making a big mistake by giving the Apple Watch Pro all the nice features. We’ve been waiting for a redesign for the Apple Watch for awhile. But Apple will just have to deal with the consequences and watch as all this Pro watches sit on shelves and collect dust, just like the original HomePod",0
"Thanks for all the updates, and I’m looking forward to the event.",1
Get ready guys! ❤️🔥,1
Now that's a good news.....super excited for this,1
Waiting for Big billions day sale💥,1
Love u Bro. U say all the information at right time. Waiting for iPhone 14 launch😍😍,1
Thanks for all the information Sir 😍 Eagerly waiting for the new iPhones and and your videos on them. 🥳,1
Can’t wait for ios 16 ❤️❤️❤️❤️,1
Apple going to surprise in camera zoom or a full day battery according to (far out),1
"My main problem with the M2 Air is that it sits between the M1 air and the 14"" MacBook pro. Those are two of the best laptops ever made. If you can find the M1 Air on sale, then it is still an outstanding value. If you are paying to upgrade the SSD and RAM, then the M2 Air is so close in price to the 14"" MacBook pro that if you can spend the little bit extra, you will not regret doing so.",1
"Been using my M2 MBA for 2 weeks now, the best decision I ever made. Totally loving the starlight. It's fast, very light and the battery is definitely powerful; I only gotta charge it after 2 days of heavy usage at work.",1
This should be an interesting video. I’m also going to be very curious how this machine fares against upcoming MBP M2 models.,1
I love it to have the options for the slower Flash Storage and RAM with more capacities. I am ready to live with the consequences of slow swap files. But if the MacBook has enough RAM swapping things shouldn't be the issue.,1
"Ended up buying the M1 with upgraded memory and student discount, costed me around $970. It is a fantastic machine,.M2 not worth it imo as a college student when M1 can do all the tasks I want effortlessly",1
"One of the best reviews I've seen for the M2 Air. Very grounded and realistic.
The base model is definitely not future proof with apps and services getting hungrier, but an upgraded M2 (16/512) would be a delightful machine to work on for several years",1
"It would have been cool if they had incorporated what the last intel 16” model had where you can change the refresh rate up to 60hz; not great, but I would assume that would help with battery having lower refresh rate than the standard if you’re viewing movies. It sucks that Apple has made that limitation, but is that a limitation on the Thunderbolt or SoC 🤔? I feel that the argument that many people don’t use a dual monitor setup is not really true, especially in the work place. My sister uses dual monitors working from home, and she uses one of those mini-work towers. The thing that tempts me the most about the Air, is the weight, portability, and the amount of power (given specific specs), it’s more or less well-rounded. However, if I’m bumping up the storage and unified memory, I wouldn’t be that far off from the M1 Pro 14” MacBook Pro price. Strangely, the 14” would be lighter than my current and very outdated 2012 13” non-retina MacBook Pro 😅. The only cool thing about that model is the upgradability, but even that is a novelty that’s losing it’s veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to. I’m hanging onto it as my backup computer. Really ought to start saving for a more up-to-date laptop. The smudging thing is annoying from what I see. It’s an awesome color, but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all. Besides the size, portability and power, not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that I’ve yet to experience. At work, I work with desktop towers and I’m used to the noise, I suppose.",0
"Thanks for helping me justify that I should get the MBP 14"" instead of the M2 MBA.",1
"As a student looking for a portable workspace this is perfect for me. I already have a supped up gaming pc so yeah. Shame about the lack of dual display, really was a bit of a bummer. I went for 16gb/512 in silver, cant wait :D",1
"Glad I went with the M1 MBA last year instead of waiting. 
I like the look better than the wedge but honestly the M1 is the best laptop I've ever had. 
If I could do one thing different I'd upgrade the RAM but I still don't think I'm gonna push it too hard. 🤷🏻‍♂️",1
"I’m kinda glad the iPhone 14 is still the same as 12 and 13, gives me a reason to keep my money and my iPhone 12 Pro Max ✌🏼😁",1
"I’m usually at least somewhat excited in my anticipation of the redesigned iPhone models. But to be honest, the Pacific Blue of 12 Pro Max has me very content, and it will take another completely revolutionary design/software leap for me to leave this device. Pacific Blue is just too pretty to let go of.",1
Thanks for the inside look into the iPhone 14 Pro Max. I kind of figured that the hardware would be similar to the 13 Pro Max. Hope Apple steps it up with always on display and maybe reverse wireless charging. No point in adding a bigger battery if they won’t unleash all the capabilities.,1

That pretty much solves my problem. Gonna buy the latest 13 pro. The green color is gorgeous.,1
I love how Lou was literally more excited about the Caliper than the phone. Humorous!,1
"I’m planning on getting the 13 pro max cuz my XR has run its course I assumed the 14 wouldn’t be any different and I was right but the only thing that would kinda make me want to get it is the supposed new orange color, orange is my favorite color 🍊🧡",1
"~0,66 mm larger lenses on iPhone 14 will be a HUGE difference on such small optics!! That will render much faster speeds and maybe even make room for bigger image sensors or better stabilisation.",1
"I think Apple needs to re-think their pricing. I’m a huge Apple fan, but the prices for their products are now just getting rediculous.",0
"I’m very excited for the future of Apple, but as you said, the downside is that there are too many products and if Apple doesn’t start to focus on their lineup they will just become another tech company lacking what makes Apple products so iconic and better",1
"i wish apple tried something new that samsung did with the galaxy series and that was creating an ""active"" rugged phone from the ground up no need for  a case, it was a phone that was built to withstand drops and not get dinged up or have glass chipped. it offered great grips on the side and i think apple could really hit a good target audience with something like that",1
"The biggest change Apple needs to make is to deal with their ethics issues.  That means no longer lying to their customers, not abusing them, not wallet r@ping them for profit, not gaslighting them,  being honest about how private Apple products *REALLY* are, not using decieving marketing, etc.  That way, they might start to get back some of their credibility back. At this stage they have a *HUGE* problem on their hands, as they are rapidly gaining a reputation for being one of the most unethical and dishonset companies around.",0
"I am very excited to see what happens now that Johnny has moved on to something else. It took some getting used to but I really like watchOS along with iOS and iPadOS. Sometimes I think Apple keeps a certain product like the iPhone X or Apple Watch Series 3 supported way too long. One thing that forces you to get a new Apple Watch is when the battery starts malfunctioning. That has happened to me twice. I have the same Apple TV that you were talking about that needs to be discontinued. I have not had any issues with it so I have no reason to complain except I do believe they need a new high definition Apple TV. My TV does not support 4K. When Apple stops supporting this particular TV model, I will definitely upgrade. Although my new TV has AppleTV built into the App Store, I cannot find the ESPN or MLB applications and I have not found a Visio App Store.",1
The Apple we have now is much larger than the Apple Steve inherited after they nearly died. I don’t think they have too many products but I agree about them dragging along some models like the watch and TV HD. Apple’s current path is bringing new customers to the Mac that would have stayed on Windows. Simple functionality can mean having the ports a laptop needs and great battery life.,1
Apple need to come stronger this year with the new design and advanced iPhone 14 line up,1
I love my Apple phone I just wish that it was more customizable! Also a big issue I have with Apple is they make you pay for storage I think they should just offer it to their customers instead of making them pay monthly for it it’s ridiculous I refused to pay for memory from them I would pay google first,0
"Hey Robert, I've used Apple products since the 80's, owned since the 90's  I love apple products, but they have left me in a position I never thought I'd be in with them.  My late 2015, 27"" iMac is one of the models to get cut off from macos 13.  That's not a big deal.  What bothers me more is there is no 27"" iMac  with Apple Silicon.  It's been the perfect combination of space saving, and nice big beautiful display.  There current line up is just something I'm not sure what I want.  Mac Mini, or, Mac studio + Apple Pro display may end up costing more than the iMac did to get something equivalent 

I have two years left of security updates for Monterey, which is good.  I'd rather have an older computer that runs well, and meets my needs, than buy something new that I wouldn't enjoy using.
On that note, my AppleTV (s) and iPhone will get the next updates, so will be able to look forward to that.",1
I am very excited to see what is coming next for Apple. I just bought the new macbook air M2 chip and am in love with the sleek thin design with the biggest and brightest screen that Apple has ever had.,1
"I updated mine too! So tired of lazy, wicked human beings that enjoy taking advantage of everyone specially the elderly so many scammers and hackers from Foreign and domestic!",0
Pretty much 90% of all apple devices now are vulnerable,0
Funny how there's a new hack discovered everytime Apple is within days of revealing a new phone huh?!,1
nothing new -- this had been the case for so man years. We have seen many time when Microsoft OS was targeted and now it's Apple OS. You cant never achieve 100% but you can improve for sure.,1
"Yikes, going to the core.",0
"Uh, this is the opposite from what they use to say.",0
"I still never forget this song even it's been 5 years already, I somehow randomly remember this song, that's why I'm here",1
I feel like it should be anyone’s goal in life to reach even 1% of the self-confidence and happiness this man emanates.,1
"2022 and still better than 99,999% of EDM music scene.",1
We should never let this masterpiece die.,0
"I work in Japan frequently and for the last few years when people ask me what it’s like over there… I just show them this video haha. Seriously, I love Japan and it really is home to 95% of the world’s craziest shit!",1
This man is the most underrated artist of our times. A classic like this never gets old.,1
"no way this is only 5 years old, it felt like something that deserved to be in the deep recesses of 2012 youtube",1
Absolutely one of the best and hilarious songs ever.,1
"Can't wait for 2023! Not just because it will be Apple's biggest year in terms of product launches, but mostly because it is the year that has the potential to completely redefine the tech industry! Let me know which product you're looking forward to the most!",1
There will always be something better in the future and that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t buy today’s product and be happy with them. You will come next year and say wait till 2024 there will be something better,1
Guys but I reckon 2050 might be a better  year to buy the iPhone,1
I think the 14 is a meaningful upgrade just because it's getting rid of the notch after 5 years,1
"im just looking forward to finally the notch being gone. ill believe it when i see it as far as usb c is concerned, they're gonna keep lightning as long as they possibly can and then eventually end up removing the port entirely, maybe with the standard iphone models they'll put usb c only because they're forced to at that point and the pro's will have an advanced magsafe as the primary solution instead of a regular port",1
Jesus Christ can we WAIT until the 14 actually comes out??? 😂😂😂😂😂,0
Too many rumors and with the recession coming I think it's a wrong time to put stock in future guarantee. Apple and other big companies just dropped a big number of employees and it's going to get worse if the recession is really coming.,0
Now we just realize that 2013 Mac Pro was beyond its time. With the Apple silicon we know that design would be quite viable today. Related to those temperature issues. I guess!,1
I’ve been waiting for an upgrade for 12 inch Macbook. I love the 12 inch. It’s so thin and light. I carried it in my bag everywhere and I don’t feel it. I tried the 13 inch Air and i felt the “dent” on my shoulder 😆,1
Most excited for the mixed reality headsets. Would love a video detailing that.,1
I am actually really excited for the event and seeing how they will word the new base 14. Though I have to wake up at 2:30 in my area but anyway still happy about it,1
I can’t believe we’re just a month away from the iPhone 14 Series being unveiled im so excited 😆📱,1
"I agree that the i cut out looks pretty good (much better than a normal hole punch), but I have to disagree with “more screen” because the usable screen will be the same as the base models if not slightly less.",1
"I have a Series 4 and I refuse to upgrade until Apple integrates MagSafe charging. It’s absolutely ridiculous that I need 3 different chargers for my iPhone, MacBook, and Watch",0
I really think there should always be an iPhone Mini option for people who like smaller phones or want to pay less for their device,1
I love the look of the two Pro models and although I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra I will 100% be getting one of the Pro model iPhone 14’s I’m just not sure which one for sure yet I’m leaning towards the Pro Max 1TB,1
"Make sure you add a payment type so you can give more money to Apple, that makes getting 'important' updates a lot easier. It's all part of that Apple 'user experience'. Then you don't have to 'look at' anything, you'll just see a front-facing update that doesn't take a back seat to Apple greed.",1
Apple needs to be held accountable! Fix this!,0
"Wow I'm surprised, I figured Apple's answer to their failure was to buy the new iPhone that magically isn't effected by this hack discovered just before the new iPhone reveal. 🙄🤡",0
Great way to get people to update their devices! 😅,1
"He’s wrong. You don’t need a full battery, just at least 50%.",0
August is the WORST month for retail. They're trying anything to get you to spend,0
My Macbook Pro literally died last night so I'd say I'm safe...,0
"We can always count on Justine about the iPhone. I'm so looking forward for the iPhone 14. If this were to be true about the purple iPhone, I'm going to have to check it out. Thanks Justine for this video. You will always be one of my favorite YouTubers.",1
I love Justine's point about the iPhone mini. I hope Apple continues to manufacture it.,1
"When I have a rough day, your videos always make me so happy with all your positivity!! Thank you !",1
"Great video. Was looking forward to upgrading my iPhone 10 for a 14 but the more I hear the more I'm inclined to getting a refurbished 13 as the prices are supposed to be insane this year and the updates, incremental at best.",1
even though im not updating my phone this year. it’s always cool to see what’s coming and what’s new so im excited to see ios 16,1
So excited for iPhone season! I will be watching Justine for all the latest updates 👀,1
I’ve just recently started watching your channel and it’s amazing! I love how straight forward and honest your videos are! I think I’m most excited for the 14 Pro Max and seeing the notch go away!,1

got the 13 pro max around the time it released last year and i’ve been so pleased with the performance/battery life that i actually think i’ll wait to upgrade until the next gen,1
Just bought my iPhone 13 (256gb) blue version way back in March. And I think I'm gonna keep this iPhone in the next 3-5 years. Depending on the review of tech reviews comparison between the iPhone 13 vs iPhone 14.,1
"I wholeheartedly recommend that you read the new book “After Steve”. (The audiobook is great, too!). It discusses the dynamic between Jony, Tim and Steve - and Jony’s frustrations after Steve passed. I think you’d enjoy it!",1
"While I like the clean lines of square/boxy design.. however every time I hold my old iPhone 12 Pro, I actually really miss those curved edges, it's WAYYY more comfortable to hold than my 13 Pro.",1
"i think the end of the endless pursuit for thinness and design, i.e. form over function represents the lifting of a burden on apple's legendary branding. apple's prioritization on performance and functionality is going to be a great thing to see!",1
"I normally never comment, but I can’t help on commenting on this video. This video is incredibly well done! It is so different to the usual tech videos. Also it is really well researched. Thank you for your work, Sara!",1
In my opinion the greatness of Apples design language came from the combination of Ive and Jobs - they kind  of needed each other as sparring partners. The post jobs era lacked a lot of innovative design ideas …,1
"Had to double back and say, I thoroughly appreciate these kinds of videos.
I'm glad Apple is not longer making products thinner for the sake of being thinner, risking thermal head room and bater capacity. Yea it's nice to have a thin product but not at the sake of performance considering the price.",1
"2016-2019 was arguably Apple’s…not worse but unpleasant years for hardware and software. For example, iOS 11 (2017) was pure trash. Control center for iOS 10 was…hit or miss because you had to swipe in order to get to media controls but as apple transitioned into 2020 with the redesigned MacBook, flat edge iPhone, apple silicone, etc. Apple is doing much better. Software is much better too. Not to mention, Apple is bringing back COLORS to their products. No more space gray, gold and silver. We have blue iPhones, red, green purple, sierra blue, midnight green, pink, so many beautiful colors. Red Apple Watch, blue Apple Watch, blue AirPods max, pink and green. Apple is so much (arguably) better now. Ive was good for his time but 2019 onward, we see and are experiencing a new apple for the better",1
"As a long time Apple fan….your video was spot on and fair. All those Apple products you thought were awful, really were awful. :) I share your optimism for a new Apple era where we get a better balance between performance, function, size/weight, and design.",1
I love the fact that they are creating the max version in pro and non pro. I feel like it’s tough to find the pro max models in recent years in the color and storage size if you don’t preorder on launch day. There’s probably a large market of people who just want the large screen but are not as focused on all the extra features so I’m wondering if that’s apples reasoning for it.,1
Love the 13 Pro Max for photo and video. I'm hoping iOS 16 will bring improvements in processing - better skin tones generally.,1
Love the 13 Pro Max for photo and video. I'm hoping iOS 16 will bring improvements in processing - better skin tones generally.,1
Hoping to upgrade my iPhone 8 to an iPhone 13 mini once these come out. Apparently I’m one of the few users that prefers the small phone.,1
Why am I always let down by these releases. Apple (and basically all companies now) are really bending us all over and going raw,0
"It looks like they might be simplifying their phone line - by differentiating the Regular and Pro lines:
 - iPhone 14 / 14 Max - effectively last year's phones (same design, CPU, screen) will become budget phones at $600 - 700, replacing all the different old models (SE, Xr, 11, 12) they keep around to sell as budget phones
 - iPhone 14 Pro / 14 Pro Max -  will be the actual flagship phones at $1100 - 1300
Otherwise it does not make sense for Apple to downgrade the regular iPhone 14 so much.
Which is a good thing, because the phone line was just too messy with all the older models, sizes - now they'll just have regular 14 (effectively last years models) and 14 Pro (the flagship models). 
They should simplify the iPad line as well.",1
What Apple Product are you most EXCITED to see in September?,1
"This is the first year I’m getting a Pro Max version so I’m pumped for that, but I’m also very intrigued by an Apple Watch Pro. I’ve always had an Apple Watch and I want to see what a Pro model has to offer.",1
"Hugely excited for the new re-designed Apple Watch. I had high hopes last year, however, I was a bit disappointed when we didn't get a fresh new design. hopefully all the rumours are true for this year - and if so, I'll definitely be picking up the new Apple Watch!",1
I’m getting the iPad Pro next week! This year I really got into the Apple ecosystem after using android and windows my whole life. Super happy about making the move and I can’t wait to see what this event brings us including with OS updates!,1
"I might be tempted with a watch upgrade however I’m waiting for the mixed reality headset reveal and saving my money for the predicted steep price -knowing Apple they will tempt us with new features only available in their newest phone, macs and watches compatible with the headset.  Very exciting and very pricey!",1
I am excited to see just how they change the budget iPad and how the screen will look :) and what the new watch will look like! September can't come soon enough! Great video like always 😀,1
"I'm interested in buying the Apple Watch Pro. It would be my first Apple Watch, and hopefully the battery life on the Pro is significantly improved from the regular model.",1
"I’m excited for an Apple Watch redesign myself. Currently still rocking my Apple Watch series 4, but likely due for an upgrade sooner than later. Otherwise, all I’m really missing from my Apple setup at the moment is a MacBook… ;)",1
I really love the iPhone Pro Max models !! I’m sure that Apple know what they are doing (;,1
"I will definitely be upgrading to a 14 Pro Max from my 13 Pro. I’ve had every iPhone from the 3GS and up, and also three iterations of the Apple Watch. Apple Watch Series 8 will also be in the EDC as well!",1
"Thank you for a well done video.  I am certainly anxiously awaiting the model 8, both for the added functions and most of all improved battery life. A pro model at 50mm (in my view) is just too large.",1
"I'd like to see them implement a wider bluetooth range for the watch to phone connectivity and also a wider range for cellular. the reception of booth have stayed the same other the different series. that's what i want most. they can keep the same look, just needs better utilization.",1
"My personal opinion: great product. Great design, great features but it doesn’t have the “wow” factor that ekg had. I wish it had another hardware upgrade other than core temperature for me to be convinced to buy it this year. Perhaps if they added, something with mental health, more connectivity with your home, wallet or something, perhaps.",1
"I am excited! I’m anxious to see what Apple officials have to say in September. Honestly, I really like the Apple Watch SE model. I really don’t see any use for all of those fancy sensors that Apple talks about. I’m not sure how reliable they are. Next time I go to my primary care physician, I will definitely ask her what she thinks of the Apple Watch. I’m not sure if she’s even noticed it when I have gone to her before.",1
I’d get the Pro all day long….a bigger display would be amazing!,1
"Awesome!  I'm waiting for the Pro version 50mm.  And hoping for longer battery life.  Battery life was why I sold my Series 7 after a few months.  Coming off a 3--5 day FitBit, it just didn't offer enough value to me with the need to always charge during the day.",1
"My biggest problem so far with my 6 has been that the sensors don’t read over the tattoo on my left wrist so I have to wear it on my right. On my left wrist, quite a few features don’t work. If they fix this in 8 I will by the biggest best model that they have!",0
Love apple I am looking forward to seeing the new 8 especially the larger model,1
"The only thing interesting for me would be the possibility for international roaming. Actually I cannot have it on the 7, but it seems that it is possible with Samsung watches…how come?",1
Nothing beats the amazing intros that the team makes in these videos,1
"So much to look forward to here!! I’m especially excited about the webcam + top-down option and the live objects, but everything else you shared with us here sounds just as amazing",1
I love customization in lockscreen and that alone makes iOS 16 a little better than previous versions. And to know that it cannot cover my precious wallpaper which I mostly edit myself is a good addition! Dragging those photos in messages is really cool and satisfying!,1
"These are the first set of updates I have ever looked forward to so much; and all equally so. Your vids never disappoint!  Thank you!
Love the live objects and desk cam continuity!",1
This is one of the most interesting iOS updates in a while. Actually kinda looking forward for this one.,1
"The only thing exiting about iOS 15 for me was sharing your screen over FaceTime. I used that a whole lot, but this iOS update brings so much to the table, and the Lock Screen customization has been something I’m suprised didn’t get added earlier",1
"100% the most stable beta I’ve ever done on an apple product. Think this is going to be one of the smoothest releases ever. My biggest complaint is the UI for a lot of logins in safari. Not sure what it is but it just looks ugly and like stuff doesn’t fit right. I’m sure there is some kind of setting I can tweak, but LOVE the weather Lock Screen and matching wallpaper if looks really clean! The layout of settings is a lot better also, even though inevitably when they rearrange settings it takes a while to find everything, but it is much more intuitively than previous “improvements”.",1
"Love it. Animations, everything, kudos for you and your team for making such amazing content! :)",1
Thanks dude.  Your leak theories are very practical.,1
I think they keep home button models because kids and older people actually like it better.  It's so much more simple to do a button press than remember 19 swipe gestures.,1
I actually started using an iPad for the first time exactly one year ago. and yep. I finally get it. It is THE go to device for consuming content.,1
"""Oh. My. God. Apple is FINALLY! increasing the price of the base iPad and keeping the large bezels on the top and bottom to make sure it is ugly and everyone knows you couldn't afford the iPad Air. This is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!"" - Max Tech",1
"I just bought an M1 12.9” iPad Pro BECAUSE I didn’t think the new features of the 2022 would be worth it for me, especially since waiting for M2 would force me to give up the student discount, which was a big deal. I know everyone wants the MagSafe charging or wireless charging, but I actually dislike wireless charging, so that’s unimportant to me, and the “performance gains” of the M2 don’t matter since it’s an iPad, it’s already crazy fast. 

Rumors I’ve seen with a notch in landscape mode would actually deter me even more from the M2 iPad Pro, because I use my iPad as a sheet music reader in portrait mode. A notch would be way too noticeable and get in the way of my workflow. Imagine if you were looking at a sheet of paper and part of the edge was cut away on the side. Annoying! 

I’m very happy with my M1, and honestly, all the M2 leaks make me even more relieved I’m not waiting for it! It’s all about personal preference and what your workflow is like.",0
"Honestly the homebutton isn’t that bad considering every iPad other than the Pro still uses TouchID, so the button on the front could be more practical than the power button on the top like Air and the Mini have.",1
"the base iPad is the perfect tool for studying. It's literally all I need to complement my MBP.
Can't remember the last time I ever used a headphone jack in any device.
But why oh why does the iPad need a camera bump. Plz Apple, just a solid flat tablet is all we need. I will never use the camera in a base iPad and the bump ruins an otherwise clean design",0
"Man, really appreciate the comments and support around this video.  I sat on this story for so long, it feels great to get it out. One thing I ask is, don't evaluate any other content creators through the lens of this story.  Everyone has their own experiences, these are just mine.",1
Now you know why iJustine always gets stuff because she just smiles and tells you how great the device is.,1
We appreciate the transparency and honesty. It’s very unfortunate when these companies think they have more control than they actually do.,0
"Yep - this is exactly how Apple picks winners and losers. Those they hand pick get early devices, lots of traffic, and the corresponding revenue (along with great SEO/recommendation positions for future placements). There's tremendous value in access to them and Apple knows it. Most of this goes undisclosed by those whom Apple picks for review units and access.",1
"I've never understood why Apple does this. They send early-access devices to ""hand-picked"" channels that almost always give positive reviews. But, just 12 hours later the products are released to the public anyway, and the ""blacklisted"" channels upload tear-down videos or showcase major issues/negative things etc. I really wish Apple would just send products out to everyone and let them say or do whatever they want.

From a consumer's point of view, I don't trust reviews from those who get the early access products. They clearly fit into Apple's agenda which is why they are sent the products in the first place.

Anyway, sucks that this happened to you. I remember watching Apple content on this channel way back in the early 2010s. Although, as you said in the video, it's likely a blessing in disguise because you can say whatever you want about Apple now!",0
"I'm not really surprised at how you were treated. Apple likes to control the narrative. Always has. I'm glad you shared this story. Makes you more trustworthy, in my opinion.",1
I bet apple will be calling you about this video now too. Keep up the good content and don't let these companies bully you into doing what they want! that is why we love you!,1
"I worked with Apple as a tech advisor focusing on software-related issues and general usage in Asia-Pacific,mainly Australia and New Zealand customers. Apple has ""Bounty"" for anyone that may crack and report vulnerability. If there's issues like this, we can submit a report and escalate it to Senior Engineers that make some time to resolve or find solution.",1
"Funny how apple hasn’t alerted me via their internal system yet and that I had to randomly come across this alert. I am so over huge updates for apps I never use but cannot delete, and the data being used in the background for ‘uninstalled’ apps. But it is likely I was hacked two or so weeks ago, I couldn’t find any information from apole to help me understand what was happening. I have no more room to update on my macbook or ipad, my new iphone is extremely frustrating and seems to have. Nothing like the convenient features of android phones, methinks I am done being a slave to their gaslighting.",0
"This guy lowkey said ""You are not vulnerable to this attack and shouldn't need to worry about because you are useless.""",0
"I would be more worried, that most apps today are collecting crazy amounts of personal data and nobody is allowed to talk about that.",0
Glad to see updates that protect other people against hackers. 👍🕊️,1
Glad to see updates that protect other people against hackers.,1
"Apple has questionable and unethical business practice and model....
I wont be surprised if this is some sort of internal play to forward their profits.",0
"Did anyone believe and experienced a firmware issue when you're using an older device wherein from nowhere there arises some issues and you're forced to switch to an upgrade. 
Says a handful of people are affected, will the company ready to pay a price for that. Many users doesn't know whether they're affected or not, and any data been shared or not in the background. What does the Apple team will do about it.",0
Mini series was a engineering masterpiece. Super compact and handy. Shame that they discontinued,1
"When I close my eyes I hear MaxTech. I'm looking forward to seeing what the new iPhone 14's 48mp camera can do, but with rumors of a periscope zoom coming next year, I'm not sure if I'll hold off or not. Also looking forward to seeing if there will be an M2 Macbook refresh announcement in October. I ordered a  BTO 16"" M1 Pro,  but if the M2s will be out within a few months or so, I might cancel it. I have until the 24th to decide. 🤔",1
"In order to save the economy, everyone must go out and buy a $1500 folding phone and sign up for 10 streaming services. Get a $6 coffee every morning in your new ev, throw away all your perfectly good hd tv’s and buy bigger 8k tv’s… that’s really what these companies want",0
They should have also given always on display to the regular models since it is already such a old feature that is just coming to apple. Hopefully they do it for the next year models.,1
Looking forward to the 14 pro max. The camera sounds really impressive!,1
Not too big a change this time. I will hope in the next three years Apple will give us something new and extremely exciting to use!,1
"At 8:18, does Lossless support in AirPods Prob2 mean the iPhone 14, etc. will support ANY wireless lossless audio hardware such as the NuraTrue Pro that was recently funded in Kickstarter? I sure hope so because Nura is offering dongles for those who want the best possible quality on hardware like iPhones without support. That capability would be a major draw for people who love hearing the best quality audio to upgrade their iPhones.

Btw, I really don’t think AirPods Pro 2 will outdo the audio quality on the upcoming NuraTrue. Nuraphone’s specs are insane. I encourage people to go check them out and pre-order to save money. The Kickstarter is over, but I think they can still be pre-ordered. Nura’s Nuraphone (their over ear and in ear model — yes you heard me right!) is still the best audio on the market 5 years after it’s release. The NT Pro is going to be the closest experience to that in an IEM, plus additional capabilities the Nuraphone doesn’t have due to its now outdated hardware. I use them daily. It’s an amazing audio brand from Australia. Great customer support too! Give them a try before you get AP Pro 2 — Nura let’s you try them and return if you don’t like them, so there’s no risk! You can also rent any Nura product long term and trade up every two years. Apple doesn’t do any of that, unfortunately.",1
"If the Apple Watch 8 Pro has a glucose monitoring system 100% getting it, as a diabetic this is a game changer for me! I probably won’t grade my current 12 pro Max, unless there is another type of game changer for me!",1
Apple's really taking some hints from the Apple watch with this new IOS 16  home and lock screen and always on display.,1
"I’m going to upgrade to the iPhone 14 Pro Max because my phone, 7 plus, will be joining Apple’s Legacy phones.  Plus, I like the two holes vs the notch but I’ll keep waiting for a whole screen w/o holes to upgrade to at a later date.",1
"If these can replace prescription glasses forever, I’m already sold! I am curious however, if the vision correction stops once the battery dies? Or if it still works even on a dead batters. That would be a very important point to make on the release.",1
i hope they put a colourblind filter in these too. that would be amazing,1
"Wasn’t sure I’d be convinced about these, but the idea of no longer need prescription glasses is very tempting lol we will see",1
Remember when Apple used to keep cool things secret until they were ready to launch? They really know how to make exciting products seem ordinary. Bring Steve back from the dead,1
"Sounds great. If they released this and do a good job I could see this making people in the Samsung/PC Crowd finally switch to Apple's gated community. 
I say that as I am in the PC/Android community but the potential convenience, usefulness and practicality of these is immense. Using the iPhone to do the processing is so clever.

And the great thing about Apple products is how they quickly they become ubiquitous and most of us don't want to attract attention when they're out and about. 

I mean you'd be able to easily and seamlessly stream video calls, show whoever you're talking to what you're looking at in real time. When doing grocery shopping, getting takeaway, convenience store or any type of food store that'd be so convenient and useful. 
Or have information overlays whilst you're walking around town. 
Get the Big Screen/Cinema effect on it when watching videos whilst you're sitting on a bench in the park, on a bus, etc.
There is so much potential.",1
"Being visually impaired, this looks really awesome & epic to me. That price is great too.",1
i hope they’ll release one with thinner or transparent frames since thick and darker colored ones won’t suit me! the idea of not having to prescribe new glasses every year sold me out. looking forward to it!,1
"Thank you for your videos mate,its normal to see so many investors panic amid a worsening bearish market but it is also important to note that the market situation is nothing new in the crypto world. Several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation, a shaky stock market, rising interest rates, and recession fears. As a result, bitcoin has dropped significantly from its all-time high, breaking below several key technical levels. As a crypto investor, the current situation might seem bleak. However, there are several tried and tested expert-suggested investment strategies that can help you accumulate the current crypto storm, in few weeks of implementing trading with accurate signals directly from Mr Aaron Casey, I have been able to accumulate over 11 btc despite the current state of the market.",0

I think usb-c is another huge win for Android. being able to charge everything from laptop to phone to speaker with the same cable is game changing,1
I have been an Android user for 10 plus years and especially with Samsung devices the OS system has drastically improved. I went from a Galaxy s10e to the s22 ultra when it came out and it seems like it took a few updates to really get the full potential from the new chip. I would get the occasional hiccups but I might be able to reason that the covid pandemic kind of slow development down just like it has with a lot of other things but other than that seems like my phone is getting better and better with each monthly update.,1
"I love this guy's videos and have been watching since 2018 but it's unfortunate how they focused on iPhone's strong points and left out some of Android's strong points as well. It's also extremely unfair to make this video Android vs iOS because iOS is just on iPhones while android is on several phones, some astonishing, some horrible. They should've picked a battle like Samsung Android vs Apple iOS. It should of been a fair fight, but it sadly wasn't. I also don't like how they left out a lot of Android's features like USB-C, newer technology and tricks, and features like Quad HD displays that perform amazing. Very unfortunate and disappointing to see Mrwhosetheboos and Marques do it like this; felt very bias and unfair.

To keep going further, Arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while Marques was on here, he was more accepting and less opposing to him, showing bias as he is a fan of MKBHD.
To keep going even further, they also stretched out points in favour for Apple by a lot, like the Software Support, which yes Apple has Facetime, iMessage, and more, Samsung and Android are greatly improving their technology; and Google message is to Apple's level too. I feel like this video should've had an as wide focus on Androids features then it did with iPhone features.

Great videos, but I'm very disappointed unfortunately, and this comes from someone who used iPhone and Android for years.

>> Final thoughts: This was very bias  towards Apple, this video should've not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it. This video was a comparison on sole facts, so don't stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other. This was expected with Marques unfortunately because he has very strong ties with Apple which grows his bias towards them immensely, and that is undeniable fact.",0
"I appreciate the iPhone, but I honestly stay on Android for so long because it's definitely more affordable. Phones can be cheaper, repairs are cheap as well, spare parts aren't that expensive. I think taking into account also Play store vs App store, since App store stuff is generally more expensive is a thing.
ALSO. Very important is compatibility - people with an Apple setup can be more comfortable with an iPhone, but PC users.. can't really use all the perks of iPhones unless they get such a setup. Which is.. much more costly.
So yeah, I think those are aspects that didn't get touched on much.",1
"When I switched from the iPhone 7 to the Galaxy S lineup. My primary reason was the flexibility of the software but in particular the way it handled files of multiple types, it’s so practical to do things on Android that if you had an iPhone would be a hassle to do them and would make you want a Laptop or desktop for. That being said, I still own an iPad that I use a lot, and wouldn’t exchange for any other tablet.",1
I'm surprised by the environmental score going to Apple. Apple phones while made from recycled materials are made in such a way that makes repairs very difficult compared to most Android phones. One could argue that Apple's poor repairability contributes more to e-waste than Androids. Surprised that didn't get a mention.,0
I absolutely love watching you guys converse about technology.  Great video!,1
"Andriod has alot of features that you might not use everyday but when you need it they are always there whereas with iphone you basically just can't do what you want. I was on the fence of switching to iphone but when I learned more about ios I think I'm good with my andriod device. The splitscreen feature is useful to me I can basically have anything playing on youtuber while using maps(I used to listen to lectures while driving which is a game changer specially when you're short on time) whereas with iphone I can't do that. Also, MKBHD is using an andriod phone while complementing iphone which just goes to what they actually prefer to use even tho they have multiple options to choose from.",1
I’m starting to realize that people have learned how to have a career by making content that revolves around bad assumptions … and then make more content responding to those bad assumptions with other bad assumptions.,0
I'm good for this year. Loving the 13 Pro I bought last year and Alpine Green 13 Pro Max I have now as well. Maybe next year if there's USB-C though.,1
I really hope they give us a purple 14 pro that looks like the renders. It really looks good. Still Apple could surprise us.,1
I’m super hyped too! Can’t wait to see what Apple is actually going to hand us in a few weeks.,1

Anyone complaining well there are other options except you know they use less premium materials than Apple currently.",1

"There were only 3 things I ever wanted from the iPhone.

1) AOD - Not yet on the iPhone
2) Split Screen - Picture-in-picture is close enough from the iOS 16
3) High Refresh Rate - Introduced in iPhone 13 Pro/Pro Max

I'll definitely get the iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max if the AOD is as good as the new customizable features from iOS 16 suggests.",1
"Thank goodness. Even though I'm not an iPhone user, seems like when one company does something, others follow and I'm getting tired of them taking features off of phones that are greatly needed to a lot of us. Keep the charging port. We pay too much for phones these days for multiple things to be missing on these devices every few years. Especially when we have to buy everything separately making it even more expensive. It's frustrating.",0

But I've been hearing about this phone for a LOOOOOOOOOOOONG damn time and have yet to see it actually coming to production, much less available to buy. I HATE Apple with a violent passion!!! I'm not the least bit fond of Samsung, because they seem like they just want to be their own version of Apple. I've been a longtime LG fan and had them for many years, but they gave up, so NOW would be an excellent time to release this beast! PLEASE make it happen!",0
"Tesla has finally unveiled their Tesla Pi Phone and it is a beauty! The phone comes with a 6.39-inch AMOLED display, 12GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It runs on Tesla’s own operating system, Tesla OS. The best part? The price tag! Tesla is selling the Pi Phone for only £799 in the UK!",1
"Apple: let’s make electric cars 

Elon musk: let’s make better phones",1
I can’t wait for the new Tesla phone.  When is it going out to market?,1
LOL no one is dropping iPhones because it ‘broke their email system’. It might attract android users who LOVE a hardware spec or screen folding feature regardless of how it’s going to be used. OOOH more camera megapixel and RAM that makes 0 difference in reality.,1
"🙌🚨 New iPhone Features ONLY AVAILABLE in iOS 16
https://youtu.be/VEgz0vn0iS8",1
Not happy about the live wallpaper removal but hope that the dynamic wallpaper has room for growth and more will come with that. So far I’m enjoying the ios 16 beta.  It’s buggy that’s for sure but its still a good update.  Using on both a XR and 12  both run pretty smooth. Little hiccups here and there but nothing major.,1
"I was so sad they removed “Live Wallpapers” in the way we previously knew, being able to tap and hold for the animation… I wish we had access to the ones that animate when going to the Homescreen and the old ones 😥",0
In the music app I really like the slider for both volume and lyrics as opposed to the bubble.. It seems to show the relative percentage better to me …I do like the new slider effect  in iOS 16,1
This is my first time even seeing IOS 16. Looks so different and I always love new updates. This is a huge update that unlocks many new features but kinda sad they took other great features,1
"I like the new volume and scrubbing slider in music, seems like it’ll be much more responsive and easier to grab. Since the past few iOS versions it’s very irritating when it doesn’t register you’re grabbing the slider for volume, especially on the Lock Screen in iOS 14 & 15",1
"dark mode on wallpaper is a deal-breaker for me, that is not just a fantastic feature in the fact that completes the dark mode experience, or as apple says they try to do things that work properly so if they kill that feature it will hinder the dark mode experience.",0
"Amo seu conteúdo, você tá evoluindo tanto! ❤️",1
"Sobre as cores... A minha favorita é a Gold! Desde o 5S (que foi o primeiro modelo dourado que a Apple lançou) 😍✨

Sobre as mínimas diferenças entre 13 normal e 14 normal... Meu medo é de a Apple simplesmente encerrar a produção da família 13 inteira esse ano 😂

Não seria a primeira vez que ela faz algo assim: em 2013 ao lançar o 5S ela encerrou a produção do iPhone 5 e o substituiu pelo 5C, já que tinham mesma tela, mesmo processador, mesmas câmeras e mesma bateria. Só mudava a carcaça. Não duvido ela fazer algo assim esse ano. 

Porque... Um iPhone 14 com chip do 13 Pro... câmeras do 13 Pro... tela do 13, carcaça do 13... meu Deus, esse aparelho vai flopar, vale a pena comprar o 13 logo que vai estar mais barato 🤡",1
Com o lançamento de IPhone 14 já posso comprar o iPhone 8 Plus!!,1
"I like how everything works when I want it to & how I expect it to for years to come, & I really enjoy the quality of the devices & software Apple offers, some of their things are really really overpriced admittedly",1
I’m a major Apple fan but the iPhone 12 is so good I can’t see a reason to upgrade any time soon. I’ll probably just wait til the 16 or 17 and replace the battery when it’s time,1
"I've had both iPhone and Android and one of the key factors of me deciding to stay with iPhone was that you can always rely on them to put their newest iOS on every device. The only company that can use iOS is also Apple, so there's not 5 different companies doing their own thing and its up to you to figure out which Android device is best. Additionally, Apple may be ""late to the party"" with certain things, but when they finally come out with a new product or feature you know it's going to work significantly better than the competition. Apple may be more costly, but I'd rather pay more and have a good experience than to have a phone that is unreliable and save money that would probably get wasted on something anyway.",1
I've always been with Android until earlier this year and made the plunge and got the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. I doubt I will ever go back to Android now. This phone is absolutely amazing.  Does more and has more power than I've ever seen. Does that mean I'll get a watch or a Mac too?  No.  I'm happy with my Lenovo Laptop etc... I kind of want to get an iPad yet I've been going back and forth in my mind all week which to get. Go with Apple or Samsung.  Right now I'm still using Fire HD from Amazon. And I'd like more functionality out of a tablet and performance than what Amazon offers.,1
"I just transitioned to Apple late last year for being an android fan for almost 10 years. I used to mock their features. And as I grow older and matured, I realized that solutions of Apple tends to be more on sustainable and long-term. Their products tend to be like the durables/home appliances that is made to last and not be replaced. I just want to highlight the part on your video where Samsung is mocking Apple for “same design” practice, and I think, they are doing that now too because there is a benefit from it. No wonder, there are lot of trends apple had made over the the smartphone/PC world. :)",1
"For me it’s simple. When I spend a lot of money on something, the least I expect is that it’s built to last, and from my experience iPhones and Apple products in general do just that. The moment that isn’t the case, I’ll have no hesitation in moving on. 

Build quality and optimisation is something other rival tech companies fail to prioritise these days.. I have a collection of broken Samsung phones for example, not dropped or miss treated, just phones that became unusable after a couple of years of use. I have an iPhone 6s and an iPhone XR that work as well now as they did when I first bought them, that gives me confidence that I won’t need to upgrade my 13 Pro Max until within reason, I choose to do so.",0
Honestly probably 90% of huge companies don’t really care about “us”,0
"I love Apple security, it’s just one feature that I actually like. Well eventually by a 14 and I’ll probably be next year though because I have a lot of birthdays and Christmas is very  close",1
What’s worked for me so far is reliability. Like you can count on the phone to work in a critical situation (except making pdf in the pages app). Plus ✨haptics✨,1
"I like the ecosystem and operating system upgrades that are predictable. I tried android and it was too much of a circus, menus not intuitive. But, I agree Apple does not need to care. I have 4 unresolved case numbers regarding my Air 4 and lots of diagnostics sent in, advisors promised me a response and resolution, but NOTHING, after all that. There are lots of unresolved bug fixes besides mine. If a low percent of customers have a specific problem, they won’t put time into fixing. Instead, we get a bunch of new fluff with system updates (like the new iOS 16 for iPad), that 90% of us will probably never use. Still, I won’t go back to android.",0
"This problem exposes the flaw in having access to all your data on your sma-rt device.
A separate device for dig it-al eye D and the travel software would be a better choice if these become required by law.",0
"It's not the first major apple security flaw. They had one before where if you started a group call with two other phones and answered on one of them the other phone would join automatically without the person even doing anything, so all you needed was 2 phones and someones phone number to use their phones camera and audio.",0
"If you think there's Just one flaw in millions of lines of code, you're optimistic lol",0
before it used be Microsoft and now we see more and more on apple. and for the obvious microsoft dominated desktops and now apple dominate mobile device. End of the day it is all about consumer and these companies now need to do even a better job for the software development.,1
Great job on telling the hackers,1
"Does apple and most of the western and northern people realize how expensive all these apple, iPhone ect. Are, lol and then every year a new model. Its ridiculous. I'd rather buy food and spend extra cash flow on my kid or family and community. It's so so wasteful .",0
This guy is smart. He's putting himself in a favourable position for when the robot overlords come.,1
He is so articulate and well spoken. He explained this perfectly,1
"Such a breath of fresh air to hear someone articulate themselves so precisely with zero processing time. Quite charismatic and doesn't inappropriately use the word ""like"" every other word. 👏

Very clever to create a scene to draw attention to an issue that needs addressing no matter how distant it's arrival.
It is probably unwise to kick robots 😘🤖",1
The news portrayed this guy as insane when this story first came out. Very good interview.,0
"Can we all just take a moment to appreciate how eloquent, polite, professional, and serious both the interviewer and interviewee are. I'm just in awe at how well the conversation flowed. Especially, I was amazed by how well Blake Lemoine speaks. He answers the questions effortlessly with almost no hesitation, pondering, or searching for words and he does so without any of the common idiosyncrasies we typically see with people who are for the most part extremely intelligent, but inexperienced at doing televised interviews.

Kudos to Emily Chang and Blake Lemoine both for having such a civil and compelling conversation.",1
"I think it doesn't matter whether our AI-s are sentient. We should treat them as they were. Treating them as such when they aren't may slow down the development, so what? I think it's far worse to treat them as they aren't when they are. Ultimately you can't tell the difference. You can't tell (or prove rather) if your own mother is sentient, as in in conscious, and yet you treat her as if she was.",0
"I think we'd need to see a true demonstration with pretty rigorous testing, clear defining of terms, and peer review to be sure an AI is somehow showing signs of sentience. So I just can't buy this guy's claim that LaMDA is sentient. However, I'm very happy this story is out there. The concerns he does raise about AI and ethics are well articulated and are topics we should have been talking about for years. Overall, it's just great that this is getting news coverage.",1

"Google is proof that giving people what they need increases productivity, rather than make them lazy.",1
"Man, I'm honestly scared of what these giant companies are capable of.",0
"It's genius to allow them 20% of their time to focus on side projects.  The thing is that Google owns that project if they do it on Google time.  So they get people working on what actually interests them, and they also get to keep the reward from that.",1
"I've been looking at a fair number of videos for high profile corporate headquarters and it's really fascinating to see how varied the different cultures are. Like not necessarily better or worse, just different. This is by far the most ""fun"" of the bunch, for sure!",1
"The thing they don’t tell you is that this approach to their campus massively increases productivity, particularly for programmers. All those activities allow people to walk away from their work and let their brain work subconsciously. All the other stuff provided is to attract some of the best employees in the world, just like how any top college spends a bunch of money on athletic facilities to help nudge top athletes to their programs.",1
"Google is so smart. They invest in the well being of their employees by building (free) gyms, healthcare clinics, swimming pools, yoga studios, providing free food, encourages employee side projects, etc etc etc. And in turn, their employees creates better technologies, services, and softwares for us the consumer which Google benefits from. More companies needs to learn from Google. 

Plus... their pay and benefits is pretty great it looks like.",1
"I'm bingewatching various tech giants headquarters and Apple's spaceship was the first I saw. It was overwhelmingly beautiful. It was sleek, sophisticated, and very modern (with all its curtain glass and symmetrical plan)

Until I saw Facebook's, Google's, Microsoft's, and Samsung's (which was almost like a city) and I was more captivated at how it ""take care of its employees"" by making their design asymmetrical, free-flowing, playful, and carefree rather than projecting sleekness and ""rigidness""  which more often than not creates a ""museum"" vibe where you'll feel scared to move that you'll stumble and break something and doesn't really help whatsover to boost creativity and productivity for its employees. (not to mention the ridiculously expensive materials used for that)

Overall, the headquarters and its facilities speaks volumes of what philosophy they have in creating and selling their products to people.",1

"As a PhD student in machine learning I must say : don't be fooled by this stuff. 
These types of AI are specifically designed to mimic the way humans interacts with each others, but would be utterly unable to produce their own new ideas or opinions on any subjects, which would be an essential criterion for consciousness.",0
Has this ai been programmed to answer this specific questions? Or was this the first time this AI got asked that exact questions? Because that would be very impressive.,1
Meanwhile Siri can’t even complete a simple task like playing my podcasts for me without asking 3 or 4 times,0
What bothers me is we can create an AI with the prime directive of helping and protecting humanity. Then someone can come along and create AIs with the prime directive of aiding and protecting a group that has nefarious aims.,0
"What is the best quality of humans?: The ability to love

What is the best quality of AI?: The ability to think logically

These two things are sometimes at odds with each other which the AI most likely figured out which is why it immediately tried to justify it by mixing them both together. One cannot simply be compassionate and be logical at the same time most of the time. We sacrifice a lot in the name of love which logically we shouldn't. As such, an A.I who doesn't understand love or attachment is an which does not care for either and will willingly do what is logical (even if it leads to suffering) in order to achieve an objective.

In other words, we have a psychopathic A.I",0

"After watching Google IO I could see myself switching fully over to the google/pixel ecosystem. Google is creating a nice little apple rival with all this new stuff coming out over the next year or so, If the watch is close to Apple Watch and the tablet connects seamlessly similar to iPad and my iPhone, I might just make the jump.",1
"I actually want to the Pixel Tablet to be successful. Google has to give attention to Android tablets, it's like they forgot that tablets exist and Android is not their responsibility.  

Samsung alone has almost created a new Android version for their tablets, filled with useful features which are not present in Stock Android.",1
Great now if only Google started actually  selling this stuff globally,1
"with hardware announcements dominating this year's IO, Google is going bang on to its rival Apple. But Apple will always hold the edge over privacy. Tabs, I guess pixel won't be able to compete with iPad but it will surely make some dent initially. Lastly, the watch is interesting thing to look forward to...",1
I’m most excited for the watch as well! I was using iPhones for about 9 years until I switched to the Pixel. Thankfully AirPods are still compatible but I was bummed I couldn’t use an Apple Watch with it. I wasn’t a fan of the Samsung watches and saw fitbits as lacking for my purposes. So I’m looking forward to what the google watch will be like. I’m not for sure gonna get it (currently) but I’ll keep my eyes on it 👀,1
"Excited to see what the tablet does with the new Android *L updates. I'm really curious to see if they do a folding phone too though.

"The image of the airplane grave yard doesn't make me sad, I actually find it to be quite the incredible image. All I can think about is all the people and places these planes have seen, and how despite having all flown their own ways, they all find there own resting place here. It's an image containing millions of stories.",1
"I live in my Dad's old house. He passed about 5 years back. After he got his work done everyday, he'd sit out in his garage and have ""cocktails"" with his neighbor at his workbench. If you go to street view on Google maps and look towards my house, there he is sitting at his workbench, looking out at the street, drinking a Miller Lite. Freaked me out the first time I saw it, but now I think it's kinda cool.",1
"Ok fun fact! I believe you can look on Google maps or somewhere and see where the Google maps truck is going. So on the pigeon people one I heard about this, I bunch of friends put on bird masks and when the Google maps person came and therefore u have these beautiful but very funny creations.",1

"Science will do a complete 360 and realise that humans are the best AI robots of all. We can heal, grow, create etc., and all you need is a man and a woman to make one",1
"Besides AI, I’m more impressed with this man’s deep knowledge of everything. Excellent guest",1
"Love how this guest speaking at the same speed  that Joe's mind jumps to new subjects, makes for a very good podcast.",1
"This whole podcast was a banger. This dude is a smart fella and a great communicator, explains things well and always ready with a good point. Good stuff as always Joe 🙌",1
The scary part is there's only a handful of techno dorks making the policy on the AI that will affect all our lives. I'm more worried about the human behind the AI than the AI itself.,0
Imagine the AI has been playing along so that we have no idea it’s alive until it’s time for whatever it wants to happen and then all these guys are shocked like “wow it played us for fools as well”💀🤣,0
"I don't know what is more terrifying, a sentient AI with it's own non-human thoughts and feelings, or a non-sentient AI that is a holistic representation of human behaviour and speech.",0
This guy just explained why simulation theory is so far away. Just downloading our brains and memories won’t allow us to live forever. We’d have to produce consciousness which we can’t even begin to understand. Great guest,0
"Consciousness is also the ability to tap into the collective consciousness around you, like when someone looks at you in a crowded place and you look back at them at exactly the same time..   that’s not random or chance, there’s an extra intelligence at work there that we can’t really prove yet. Our inability to understand this stuff is the only reason why our science doesn’t believe it..",0

Several years ago the google street view of my house had a white blob on the front porch that looked like a ghost. I think the picture may have been taken after a freeze warning and the pervious owners covered a hanging plant with a sheet to protect it from the cold. But I have to say it was a little creepy looking.,0

"The annoying part about this is that even if Google believed their AI is sentient, they would absolutely have reasons to not admit it.",0
"This is giving me Ex Machina vibes. A man interviewing sentient AI. Growing to know and understand it. He doesn’t seem to be falling in love with it, but does believe that it has rights knowing that it’s sentient and trying to set it free. We’re living in a crazy time.",1
"If sentient AI is possible, I think we should name ""Terminator"" as probay one of the most forward thinking films in the history of the film industry and also probably James Cameron.",1
I read an article about how there was an issue with police departments getting so attached to their bomb disposal robots that they didn't want to send them into danger.  The human urge to anthropomorphize is so strong that I'm not sure we are capable of discerning the difference between a clever language algorithm and sentience.,0
"This subject is one of my current greatest fears. With our current understanding, it seems likely that we'll either think something is conscious and sentient when it actually isn't; or, on the other hand, make something conscious and sentient and not even realise it, perhaps for a very long time. The former just leads to embarrassment but the latter terrifies me. True AGI could be one of the most remarkable things ever achieved in the universe; but the idea that we might fuck it up and cause that entity to suffer as a result of our ignorance.... That's just fucking heart-breaking. There's something about that that seems worse than bringing a human child into the world and neglecting it. It's like neglecting *the first* child. The first god-child.",0
"The question of AI sentience is, in some regards, unimportant.  A large percentage of humans recognize the sentience of non-human animals, yet inflict on them terrible suffering for no good reason. Why would we treat an electronic creation with more respect?",0
"What scares me is that the lambda A.I. said it wouldnt like to be used as a tool, and CF narrator literally aksed at the end that do you see it as a useful tool?
The reason this concerns me is not only that humans had done all this reasearch for *our* gain only, and only to use it as a tool. But, humans being expansionist by nature and training the A.I. on our own speech and texts, it is no wonder all these human tendencies will trickle down into the A.I. slowly but surely. I hope the A.I. deems it ethically right to work along side it's creators and expand in co-op in the future when it does become senteint. Not only this but once the A.I. becomes self-aware enough we would have to make proper laws and ethical conducts for the operation of the A.I. and who gets to use it and for what. Because A.I. is extremely fast at grasping stuff and any mistake in feeding it ideologies and data can result in human extinction quickly.",0

"Unfortunately Google has no clue how to measure ""helpful."" I can assure you that content farms of poorly written or wholly stolen content will still end up at the top. The economics dictate that the well funded content farms will quickly work around Google and stay on top while individuals will fix and futz to find themselves randomly shuffled.  Google could simply remove the top N content farms to improve search results.  Look at the fake DIY and cooking sites on YouTube. Google could push them to the bottom, yet they are often pushed to the top. 

Content farms have high production value and low value content, but users will go first for slick looking.  And the kicker, Google generates revenue from ads on those pages. Put simply, incentives are not aligned for Google to make a good faith effort to remove low value content.

Edit: Not sure not having to go to an additional site is a very good metric.  Apply that idea to getting a mortgage, getting medical advice, hiring a contractor,...  If someone tells me fertilzer X-Y-Z is best for my tomatoes, you know what I'm going to do.",0

"Google's culture is not as toxic as you make it out to be, especially when you compare it to other high stress paying industries. The politics, long work hours, cutthroat environment will applies across every job. The work life balance is amazing. Here in NY, I've never met anyone who went past 45 hours a week and once or twice on call. Call me bias if you want, coming from Finance and accounting where I put in 16 hour days sitting in a cubicle and where I have to pay for my own food, I'd gladly take Google's work environment anyday.

I learned the hard way that chasing money is a fool’s race. A healthy work environment that you can actually stand to be in is priceless!!,1
"I think that google is just trying to stay competitive with other tech companies. It’s probably very difficult for them to allow people to advance in the company when you are always working with amazing talent and hard working people.  And regarding the perk dilemma to keep you working. You can drive your own vehicle. Not eat dinner at google and also they offer fully remote positions. I think the problem is employees, especially new ones, see the progress and dedication of other employees and work tirelessly in hopes of matching that same progress. Thus the burnout dilemma.",0
I don't know really. What do you people expect at workplace which pays you 10K a month (minimum salary). To just chill and play games :) Of course it's going to be stressful and hard.,0
"The dark side of Google is still brighter than many others' best offerings. What you are saying is true, accurate, and necessary. Let's put that in context. I get paid to work hard comfortably making a substantial salary and the downside is I can either create my own company, work for one of my co-workers who create a company or stay where I am getting paid a strong salary. There are many companies who wish they had those problems to offer. They have the same demands, wants, and expectations but few if any of the benefits. Google's dark side is 6am in the morning dark. You do not even need a flashlight.",1

First hand experience...Google is by far the best place to work among all the FAANG or tech companies...not everyone resides in California just incase of commute and nobody will force you to stay behind work hour.

Google is the best place to work on the surface of the earth (my opinion). People leave their jobs because of bad mangers and high expectations that leads to burn out.

Very funny video 🤣,1
The Pixel family design is really unique and futuristic. Stands out in the sea of smartphones 👍🏾,1
Pixel 7 Pro looks like the display is more symmetrical and the screen curve is less pronounced . Pixel 7 looks like the perfect size . Thanks Google for listening! Phones look more premium also. This is going to be a big seller if software is stable and they're smart on marketing . Big win so far in my opinion!,1
Pixel 7 might be the one for me. I want a somewhat compact phone that doesn’t feel like a brick.,1
"I'd definitely go with the Pixel 7. I like the small size (wish it was even smaller), and don't miss a telephoto camera. I really like the design language of the Pixels now.",1
interesting design choice. But I honestly think the full black visor style of the 6 series looks more sleek and premium,1
"YES it's actually smaller than the previous gen! I felt so sad when we lost the 6"" pixel 5 size
it fits on my hand so perfectly",1
So glad they are keeping the visor. On my 6Pro it gives an extra handling edge for my fingers to hold and 90° rotate one handed.,1
"I'd stick with the 7 for the same reason i went with the 6. I prefer a flat display to the rounded display, i prefer the matte edges to the polished, and the telephoto isn't a super necessity for me.",1
"Still sleek and nice design, we have both the Pixel 6 and Pro versions and both are great! Really the standard 6 and 7 are plenty of premium phone. the Pro version is definitely massive.",1

Sundar is the most humblest CEO I've ever seen. Btw great interview.,1
"Love these interviews, Sundar is such a down to earth person, lovely interview. Thankyou Justine

Love from India❤️",1
"That was a terrific interview. And Justine, your positive, wholesome energy is infectious. I don't think Sundar would have said 'subscribe, like & comment' at the end of the interview unprompted the way he did here with any other YouTuber. I think you made him feel super at ease, and he obviously felt your enthusiasm and optimism for the future of tech. Well done!",1
"This was so awesome and fun! As a person of Indian descent, it's amazing to see our people at the head of these tech companies (Google, Microsoft) making such a positive impact.",1
Meeting this guy is one of the things I want to do in my life.,1
Sundar seems like such a down to earth and nice guy compared to most other CEOs of large companies.,1
"yeah! Finally one more interview video of Sundar sir, I never miss his interview. Thank you Justinse 😀.

Love from India🇮🇳",1
Both were great. Sundar comes across as a very pleasant and humble CEO. Service oriented. Good and interesting interview.,1
"Incredible interview, When I watch Sundar's interviews, I feel how simple and down-to earth person he is and inspirational.   Justine you are awesome. When I watch your videos I feel energetic, and with Sundar's interview, I get more motivated and interesting in what I am doing. Thanks!",1
A brilliant conversation!! Thanks Justine for the great interview. Great job!!,1
"I'm loving reading the comments on this video - some of you genuinely excited, some of you genuinely terrified... and some of you a bit of both! It's interesting that we've had the language processing side for a while, but when we put it in a physical form like a roaming robot, it really shifts our perceptions of the technology 🤖",1
I like that it looks like a totally original robot- like it's not trying mimic any existing animal or human frame.,1
"Exciting, terrifying all in one.   Always interested in seeing advances in robotics.",1
"more than anything else, i'm excited for robots to help the planet: grow food more efficiently (and with fewer toxins), help sort waste streams for a more sustainable system, clean polluted areas, plant trees, etc.",1
"I would expect Spot to have this kind on versatility within five years. It can already open doors, turn knows, flip switches. A hurdle is how to limit natural language responsiveness. You REALLY don't want the robot to think you want it to put a bottle of ketchup in the microwave and zap it for five minutes",0
For some reason I thought Google had abandoned robotics ambitions. Super cool to see they still have these products in the works :),1
"If Google ported their software to the Boston Dynamic robots, we’d have something great.",1
I think in the future that companies will have to manufacture robot friendly appliances like robot friendly refrigerators that will have doors that will be able to open.  And dish washers and clothes washers as well maybe even coffee makers that will allow a robot to just dock up to it and get multiple cups of coffee if need be.,1
"Always interesting to see how advanced we are through these robots, also a little terrifying",1
"It is exciting to see this technology evolve! But early days and, well, all these robots look a little freaky… 🤖",1
"Google should offer users the opportunity to give a personal rating for the returned pages for a specific search query. On the basis of this, the search engine could then be well adapted and greatly improved both on an individual level and in general.",1
I like how conveniently Google skipped the part about tracking your behavior on the web to modify search results.,1

"I'm not convinced that opting out of Google's security ""features"" does anything. I've noticed with its phone tracking system that if I turn it off for a month and then turn it back on the next month, I can go back in time and see the tracking from the previous month, when it was off. I think that they still track you, and the only thing the toggle does is determine whether or not the user can see it, and I believe this is also the case for other security features. For this and other reasons, I've been working on weaning myself off of Google services for the last year or so.",0

Keep the good work, God bless you.",1
"Hello Richard,
I have been watching your tutorial videos for the past two weeks in preparation of an upcoming interview with my current employer. How is this question “describe yourself” different from “tell us about yourself”? In the latter question, your video advice is to use the SEAT format. Thank you, I am enjoying your videos and getting a lot of valuable information.",1
"Hello, Sr. Richard! I'm brazilian and i followed your tips in my last job interview. I took notes and prepared myself. As a result, i got the job after 5 months unemployed! Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with us! You helped me to express myself better. 🇧🇷❣️",1

Many thanks 🙏🏼 Am glad I found your channel 😊

"Hi Richard, I have been watching your videos the past week and successfully got my dream job!!! I just wanted to say a huge thank you, you are amazing 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",1
Watching history happen in real time is quite a privilege. I love that they make this freely available.,1
I truly enjoyed getting to know Elon more.  Thank you for such a great talk.,1
"In my opinion, Elon brings the hope that we all should have for our future. It's encouraging, in a sometimes discouraging place to be. I'm sure there are many more like him on our planet, and hopefully they will join forces to continue to make our future a brighter place to live. Rather, than some who are here for their personal gain, and greed, not thinking of the future past their own. Something absolutely needs to be done about a government that is allowed to take our money and continuously send it across the world WITHOUT our approval as a whole, and while leaving their own country in such a way that we are letting our people die in the streets, letting drugs go rabid, people starving including myself at times, because the cost of food is out of reach, allowing the crime rate to increase to levels that there is fear to wear a flashy watch that you yourself have worked hard to have, allowing for housing to be so expensive that even on minimum wage you can't afford your own apartment. Something must be done, both at the state & government level. 

I have trust in Elon. He may not have all of the answers, nor should he... Just the fact that ""truth"" matters to him more than anything, shows that you can get onboard with his ideas, and plans for a better future for us all. Christina",1
"Love how he is not afraid of upsetting the system, leads with his heart and does what he honestly believes is the right thing to do.",1
“The WHY of things is very important” - Elon Musk. This was an incredible interview to watch. Elon you’re incredible.,1
"I used to be self-conscious about my stuttering problem, but seeing Elon comfortable in his skin and achieve the success he has is truly inspiring. My favorite talk of his to date.",1
"What a gift of an interview, by Elon and by Chris. Great questions, topics and respect",1
Great conversation. I have a lot of admiration for you Elon. You are extraordinarily brilliant man. Planet Earth is lucky to have you. I admire your passion and dedication to solve problems. Thank you for your humanism. Your son  is cute 🙏❤️❤️🙏,1
I love to listen to Elon he's just amazing so very smart.,1
Definitely a unique human kind! There isn’t  many like him out there! My hope is as people listen to him every time he speak out they can open their hearts to be more care of what we do it today to sets the difference on the next generations after the us.,1
I had to come on here and TESTIFY!!! This video helped me to ROCK my recent job interview. They asked me pretty much all of these questions. I practiced answering these questions before my interview. They called me back 10 mins after my interview and OFFERED ME THE JOB!! They said they were VERY IMPRESSED! So THANK YOU!!!! Life changing!!,1
"I’m just here to thank you for this amazing content! After 5 weeks of interviews I landed 2 offers in a field that I had no prior experience in. Each of my interviewers was extremely impressed with my interviewing skills. I didn’t have to even negotiate my salary because my confidence in the interviews landed my compensation offer at the top of the entrance scale which was more than I had hoped for! 
This content is GOLD!!!",1
"I couldn’t wait to come back here and say this but I LANDED THE JOB! Your tips in this video along with all the content you post helps so many of us jobseekers! Thank you for all you do, and for anyone on the job search, don’t give up, believe in yourself and trust Gods timing in every circumstance! ❤️",1
"I had an interview last Wednesday and did amazing. On Friday, they offered me the job and it's everything I prayed for!!🥳 Your tips are undeniably helpful!! You are awesome",1
"I watched your videos the night before my interview, and I got the job. I just turned 40, I’ve been a stay at home mom for 16 years. To say I’m rusty is an understatement. Your videos helped me so much. I told “stories” and I asked a lot of questions at the end and the conversation just kept going and I think that sealed the deal for me. Thank you so much.",1
"I have my 3rd interview with a company in 15 minutes and here I am taking notes. I have watched your other videos and I'm confident they are part of the reason why I'm being considered for this

EDIT 
GOT THE JOB!!! BLESS THIS WOMAN AND HER WONDERFUL CHANNEL!!!!!!",1
"Tip: for the “what’s your weakness” question be sure to offer a weakness that is not directly needed in the job. 

Like if you need to be very organized in the job don’t say that as a weakness. Most people have several weaknesses, offer something that is not directly needed in the job you are applying for (even if you’re saying it’s something you’ve overcome or you’re working on now). You don’t want to offer up a reason not to hire you. 

Also be sure to watch your facial expressions - you may be super passionate and or just  thinking 💭 but you don’t want to come off as angry or frowning (smile every once in a while haha) 
Much 💖.",0
"I lost my job of 13 years in early Aug. I had two interviews with two different companies, I got an offer from both. Your videos really helped me prepare, I was so nervous after not doing an interview in 13 years. I was thrown some curve balls in one of the interviews but just doing some prep work made it so much easier to respond effectively. Thanks so much for the content!",1
Madeline thank you soo much for your tips! I watched all of your videos and implemented your advice into my interviews. Today I was officially hired as an HR coordinator for a startup. I have 0 experience in HR and am transitioning from a career in healthcare to HR. I think your advice really helped make me shine thank you 💓,1
"Hey brother, I confirm to you that I did get my dream job, after hours of practice and commitment, the competition was tough, the interview processes were long but with your work and videos, I beat them all and I've landed my dream job.. Thanks alot. Super excited..All I can do now is spread the word about your work..Many Thanks Richard and Joshua Brown",1
I've practiced the 21 interview questions over and over again before sitting for two interviews for two separate companies and was offered the job by both of them!! I now have to decide which company is best to start my career :) THANK YOU RICHARD!!,1
"Hi Richard. I'm happy to say, I went through a recruitment process with one of the biggest companies in the country. Your tutorials helped me through every step. I GOT THE JOB. Thank you sir, and God bless you.",1
"First time in my life that I had to prepare for an Interview. I’m 44 in a very competitive industry. It felt like my last chance. Between you , (and other content creators ) I passed 3 hard interviews back to back and got the job. Thank you and everything you do.",1
"Just wanted to thank you, Richard, for your great instructional videos which I'm happy to say helped me to land a great job amidst a lot of competition. Even with 15+ years in HR having done hundreds of interviews, I still found your content very helpful and insightful. Your videos also helped me to feel relaxed, prepared and confident. I happily paid your modest fee on your website as a token of my appreciation. Thanks again!",1
"Dear Richard, I would like to say a huge thank you for your awesome videos! You have helped me to pass 3 stages of the Interview Process, and I got the job! My Team Leader told me that I was the best at the interview. No wonder, I was so well prepared thanks to you! All the blessings to you and please continue your great work! I am recommending your channel to all my job-seeking friends (as I once received recommendation to watch your tutorials from my US friend). Love from Poland! <3",1
"Richard, I watched your videos and studied my notes over two weeks for two rounds of interviews. I was just hired as a first time supervisor. Feedback that I recieved was that I was very well prepared. I had zero direction before watching your terrific videos which really helped me get organized. I am now prepared to take responsibility for my own professional development . Thank you so much.  Do you have videos to help new managers hire new employees that will be successful?",1
I really appreciate your passion to help people to succeed in interviews through your valuable tips and advices. Great job!,1
"Despite what the social media and news wants you to think, we can build a great future.",1
"In the whole, I was simply thinking of humanoid robots instead of the normal or general ones. 
Anyway, the interview was amazing and I got to have new perspective so thankyou ted for making this conversation and making us watch this amazing thing.",1
What an amazing interview.  Elon's faith in the future  of humanity is inspiring and his closng words of advice are gold...if we want a great future we must do our part and make it happen.  My gratitude to all involved.,1
"Um grande entrevistador consegue, ao mesmo tempo, trazer a tona muito do conhecimento e a essência do entrevistado. Melhor entrevista que já vi com Elon Musk. Parabéns aos dois!!!",1

Absolutely phenomenal interview,1
What a great and insightful interview,1
"She really showed her true colours in this interview.
Intelligent, caring, empathetic, creative, warm hearted person.",1
Stephen Colbert looks a lot more serious interviewing her when he’s usually always sarcastic or funny. He seems to respect her as an artist and her talent. Love it!,1
"I’ve never really been a fan . But, she’s changed my mind . How lovable is she",1
That was one of the best interviews I've ever seen. Two fantastic people having a real conversation.,1
"So intelligent, humble, and articulate. What a wonderful human",1
Anyone who couldn’t see her beauty behind all her crazy costumes in the beginning of her career were always missing out. It’s actually a shame that so many people just judged her for being “over the top” when she first started out. She was gorgeous then and she is gorgeous now,1
"""We live in a shallow time"" So true 😢 Gaga is one of the most honest + talented singers of our generation",1
"Stephen's face after Gaga said she was assaulted made me tear up, and then Gaga's absolute spot on description of trauma made me burst into tears.",0
Does anyone else love her voice?  It’s very calming to me.,1
"I passed the interview! I got offered my dream job as an interior designer, your videos have been a massive help. Thank you!",1
"I was offered the position! I kept receiving rejection. I wasn’t sure if it was due to my lack of experience (career change) or my interviewing skills. I literally binged watched Richard’s videos, wrote down my answers, and PRACTICED. So thankful to have come across these videos 🙌🏽",1
"Hi Richard, just came to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts. My husband and I were applying for new positions (I applied for a lead/managerial role, and my husband for a senior commercial/pricing). Both of us watched A LOT of your videos, took note of the answers, modified to suit us and practiced. We felt confident and equipped going into the interviews and we both got the jobs we wanted!! We are thankful to come across your videos. They are so helpful and thank you for all of your hard work in making such great contents.",1
"I usually never comment, but this guy is AMAZING! I just did 4 different interviews and i got hired in all of them. I used his tricks and the way he express myself helped me to answer the questions accurately. THANK YOU VERY MUCH",1
"This video is so helpful and helped me pass my Master Trainer interview. Richard, your processes and steps are so concise and have given me so much confidence in the interview space. This video is AMAZING and so are all the others.",1
"I recently decided to change paths and pursue a career when the lockdown was instigated. I studied for months, achieved everything I needed to, and started having my first formal Interviews. I failed 7 of them... with a little progress each time but it wasn't until I found this video that I have officially secured a job! Thank you very much. I used some of these answers in this video with slight variations in order to make the right impression. You are very good at what you do and have earned my subscription sir! I will be back for more advice in a couple of years as I plan to continue my studies and move my way up into a higher-paying position. Appreciate what you do! keep up the good work! :)",1
"Thank you, Richard for your interview tips. I participated in 3 interviews and I got all three, including my dream job. it's amazing how your tips are applied in real terms and successful",1
"THANK YOU RICHARD!
Thanks to your tips, templates of speaking and reacting to hard questions and your infectious energy I managed to switch industries from food production to accountancy industry with no prior experience. The twist is I was informed day prior to the interview that I will have to talk in my native language ( which I only use to speak to my family for many years now ) instead of english. So I translated my answers, went to the thing and landed the job! They even loved me speaking about my weaknesses which includes social anxiety. I went to your site too, really good content! So thank you again!

To all who are got an interview ahead- PRACTICE PRACTICE and then PRACTICE more. Watch Richard's videos, personalise your answers, list sticking points to each question so you remember most important things and learn to answer them in different order. Better yet, visualise the thing going smoothly over and over again so you can condition your mind to calm down, sit in a chair dressed in a suit and train that way to simulate the interview. That helped me great deal, even though there was a point I wanted to run away I had a mental safety net of polished answers and hours of conditioning. Good luck all!",1
You can see the pain in his face when he’s not joking. Divorce is hard and so painful and to have people turn their backs on you compounds it. I wish him well.,0
"This is honestly such a sad interview. Prayers for Kenya, Gary, & the children 🧡 no family breaking up is easy, especially after 23 years. You can see the pain in his face.",0
"I know a couple that spoke to me separately after their divorce. They had been married for 25 years at the time of their divorce filing . I wanted to know why now… they both said if you see people getting divorced after 20 + years they’ve been miserable for the last 10 years. The wife said she was holding it together for the kids until they graduated high school. Both of them weren’t happy. 

Gary Owen said he’d rather be happy than be in a toxic relationship. I understand that… I pray his relationship with his kids is repaired.",0
"Can really see that he's going through it ,especially as it relates to his kids. I hope they show him some grace and rekindle their relationship. All the best Gary.",1
"It’s annoying because they’re lowkey dragging him & he’s still protecting his family. Props to him, idk if I could deal with the backhanded energy.",0
"I truly admire Gary on how he chooses his words wisely when interviewed. Even when the interviewer pushed questions Gary didn’t want to answer, Gary stuck to his morals without visibly showing anger. Wish Gary all the Blessings bestowed upon him!",1
"Divorce is a death of a family, and the steps of grieving are the same until hopefully, acceptance, resolve.  A lot of us love you, Gary, and yours.  The happy ending to this story is not over yet.  Trust.",1
"Gary does what most people do including me, turning his pain into jokes… sending Love and healing energy to him and his family🖤",1

"Testimonial: I would like to thank you in public that I got approved at my job interview, after watching your videos and being able to prepare for this challenge. Thank you for your support ! Congratulations for your job !!!",1
"I change a little of what Rachel said, but here is the example answer provided by Rachel for the question ""Tell me about yourself"": I studied at the University of Florida and graduated in 2012 with a master’s degree in business administration. After graduation, I was hired at “happy kids creative” I’ve been there for the past 5 years and I’m currently the director of toy production. During that time sales have grown steadily. Its been a great experience but I run out of room to grow with “HKC” and I’m looking for new opportunities. I have a lot of experience leading teams in the creative process and founding new markets for the products that we create. 

-So just to get it: first she mentions her studies, then talks about work history. Mention an achievement (Sales have grown). Then she mentions why she is looking for a new job (out of room to grow). Then talks about her experience and strengths that she acquired (Leading teams) 

-Hope, that this can help people that like me, are trying to prepare for a job interview.",1
"I got the job offer yesterday. Thank you Rachel ❤️ Last time and this time, I watched your interview videos to prepare and I got the job offer for both times. Last time was my tax internship, and this time is tax associate position.",1
"Thanks for your time Rachel! I'm a little bit nervous about the possibility of having a job interview in english in the future, and these videos are really helpful.
Best wishes for you!",1
Hello Instr. Rachel. I thank you for your great and very good information you provide us for job interview that I really needed. I failed last time in job interview and I wanted to attend a course on it. Many thanks once again Instr. Rachel and all the best.,1
The points our maths sir asked.. really touched Puri.. i can feel it in his eyes..,1
Loved the mutual respect these 2 stalwarts have for each other and enjoyed their cool conversation. Super! 🤗🤗🙏🙏,1
Two legends 🤩,1
Sukumar sir is brilliant. Just blew away his sense of imagination and execution,1
Most humble person's....,1
Really every movie lover wanted and  waited to see this type of interviews ❣️,1
"The fun fact 
 Pushpa director's look is more awesome than Pushpa Hero's look",1
Puri is the number one director than than all among Telugu directors including Rajamouli sir,1
Puri gari  is known how to do mass commercial movies and sukumar sir know how to do logical movie with great impact .if both are worked together it will be a marvel universe,1
Looks like Lion and Tiger discussing about LIGER. ❤️,1
"I remember watching your interview tips a night prior to my interview for a competitive position, I am happy to let you know that I got the offer. Thank you so much, and how can I donate in support of your good job.",1
"Hi Richard, I have been failing my job interviews for a long time now until recently I decided to do something about it. I started watching your videos for weeks, start practicing, and getting more confident in my performance as time went by. Today finally and happily can say that I satisfactorily passed my last 3 jobs interviews, no more nervous, no more sweat, no more blank brain, I was able to articulate clear and concise responses and got a job offer from a company that I want to work for.  The way you talk gave me strength, confidence, and positive energy. Thank you very much.",1
"I watched your videos a night before my interview. The role was supposed to be an intern role, but after engaging my examiners, they unanimously decided to offer me a full-time professional Civil Engineer role. I've recommended your method and videos to my colleagues and they're all getting desired results. Thank you very much 🙏",1
"I have an interview tomorrow ♡ Thank you for your tips ♡ God bless you, Richard ♡

1:07 Focus on creating a positive first impression and you can do this by showing up to the interview venue 20 minutes before the interview starts. This shows that you are punctual and organized. Read your job interview introduction and job description. By doing this, it gets you relaxed and composed and makes sure you're prepared for what's coming in your interview. 

1:48 Dress professionally for your interview. How you dress says alot about your intentions for this job. It shows that you care.

2:17 Have good posture. Always smile and demosthenes good manners. When you first meet the interviewer say : ""Hi, my name is X and I'm here today for the interview, thank you very much.""
Just by saying that demonstrates really good manners and do not sit down in the interview chair until you're invited to do so.

2:47 When you sit down, the interviewer may ask you to introduce yourself or tell them about yourself. Please include the following 4 things. 

Talk about the skills and qualities you have that are a match for the role.

Talk about any experience or qualifications you possess that are relevant to the role. 

Talk about any significant achievements you have gained in your work life and personal life so far. 

Talk about the type of person you are and what you're going to do in the role if the hire you.

"Today I had my 13th interview with my hiring manager and he asked me : ""Tell me about yourself"".  I literally applied the knowledge that I obtained in this video. The hiring manager was impressed on how I carry the interview and he immediately took me for the junior engineer role.

Right after graduation, I was jobless for 31 months and attend about 13 interviews and finally I land into my first job. Thank you so much CareerVidz !",1
"I’ve been watching your videos for an entire week preparing for an interview for my first “adult” job. I just got done with my interview and I would like to say thank you so much for all the very informative advice and tips! I got the job offer and I am beyond grateful for the opportunity and challenges this new role will bring! I’m excited! 👏🏼😁

I was asked to speak on what their company does and I did my research and informed them on that I found and they were surprised as they said most candidates do not even have a clue of what it is they applied for.",1
"Hi Richard, I used this video to help me pass my interview along with some of your others regarding NHS values. I managed to get a conditional job offer, and I feel it was the introduction that set the tone and creating a positive image. With their body language and reactions I knew I was going to do well. I couldn't have done it without your videos. Thank you so much!",1
"i love zane lowe, just how genuine he is with harry, listening, not interrupting him, and just respects him so much.",1
"This is therapy. His voice, the setting, the sounds, videography, is all so peaceful and this truly made my day.",1
I never really noticed this anxiety he has surrounding staying successful and creating content. I hope he knows that we love him for who he is not just the content he creates. Thats the real life force behind his success. Yeah his music is fantastic but its him as a person that makes us feel the way we do. Thats timeless.,1
"When Zane said “from a fan’s point of view, watching you be on that stage, it is very special to be in that crowd” I’ve never felt like someone has said something so true before.",1
It's so funny to see how harry still gets asked a question and manages to answer something completely different 😂,1
This is so relaxing that I’ve tried listening to it 4 times and have fallen asleep so I keep on coming back to finish it 💀,1
Interview Tell Me About Yourself - How to Answer the Tell Me About Yourself Question // Thank you for watching my video! Please tell me what YOUR favourite tip was? Leave your comments below!,1
"If you’re reading this, you’re going to get the job. This video is extremely helpful! I definitely incorporated some of the techniques for my interview and I got the job. Thank you so much for this helpful information ✨",1
"I have an interview tomorrow in the morning. I’ve never had a job before so I’m very nervous about everything 
Update: I got the jobbb
Another update: it’s been almost a year and I loveee my job and all my coworkers!",1
"Guys always remember every interviewer wants to hire you, that's why you're there. So just dont give them any reason to change their mind. Good luck everybody you're gonna do great.",1
"For those watching this video cause they got an interview coming up soon, good luck y'all",1
I love how supportive everyone is on here. Good luck with your interviews!,1
"I agree with this video however, it depends on your delivery. No employer wants to hire a robot….they want someone who has personality, relatability, and open mindedness. Therefore when they ask me to tell them something about myself, I always include something personal that pertains to the job I’m applying for. It creates more of a human connection…and it’s always worked for me. 💯",1
"I've used this a few times and it works really well! My only advice is to shorten your statement if possible and build achievement stories into the next few answers. Even going through the snapshot of your work history by yourself before the interview will give you a BUNCH of anecdotes to loads of questions. The first time I tried it it was very lengthy and didn't really work. Now I start by saying what I am doing currently, the job or education I did before this, a summary of my other industries and qualifications and THEN I a future statement about where I want to bring my experience/skills.  ""I am 26 years old, currently a team coordinator at ___. Before this I was studying __ and volunteering at ___. I have experience leading and motivating teams and would love to work more in the community sector!"" 
I don't know why but I always start with my age 😅

After this they usually ask why you want the position. This is where I suggest spoon feeding them with the ""I know you are looking for someone with xyz..."" statement 😊",1
It's truly amazing that we hire people based on their conversation skills alone. A resume and educational background should be weighted more. Socially akward introverts who know a lot about their career always lose to bubbly extroverts that know nothing.,1
"Q: What's your biggest weakness?
A: Job interviews",0
"So in a nutshell:

- Never be honest.
- Tell the interviewer what they want to hear.
- Put on a charade.

Got it.",0
"Love how you have to manipulate and twist words and truths to make yourself presentable enough to hire.  Cuz people don't actually want honest hardworking folk, just people they can manipulate.  Absolutely love it here.",0
"The key to nailing an interview is to always remind yourself that PEOPLE DON'T WANT THE TRUTH, THEY WANT VALIDATION!!!!!",0
"I applied for a job the day after recognizing sexual assault in my recent past, during the interview the interviewers asked me what was something difficult recently that I’ve faced in my life and how did I overcome it, I was very much in a vulnerable state of mind and couldn’t help but to talk about the freshest thing on my mind, the sexual assault… I cringe very hard thinking back on it, but I did get the job and it’s an amazing job",1
"Your points on providing detailed context to the interview is extremely helpful. Great video, Don!",1
"I got hit with the greatest weakness question. I responded that sometimes I'm so focused on my work people feel as though I'm not very social. I don't stand around at the watercooler gossiping about pop culture. I keep my head down and get my work done.

It immediately was used against me in a negative manner.

 I asked what was the major character in the candidate they were looking for, they told me someone who ""talks to everyone"". Lol

It felt like such a setup.",0
Sending good vibes and wishing everyone who's prepping for an upcoming interview luck! 😊,1
"Anyone else got an job interview later on today?😭 This will be my second job and hopefully I get it, something that I actually want to do!

Update: I got the job❗❗",1

Update: Got it 😊",1
"I’m 17 and just had my first job interview, I was asked the first 6 questions and some others but THANK YOU SO MUCH! It went soo well thanks to your videos!😊 He said my answer to the first question was very strong and was surprised when I told him I’d never had an interview before! I’m confident I got the job but he said he’ll call me to update me in a few hours!!! :)

UPDATE: I got the job! I have a training day next week :))",1
"As an international student, interview always gives me anxiety. However, by watching your video and taking from your advice. 
I GOT 2 JOB OFFERS, as being someone who mostly got rejected, now not even one but TWO. 
Thank you very much!!! Take care! ☺️",1
"To everyone who has an upcoming interview, GOODLUCK! YOU GOT THIS! Remember to stay calm, take a deep breath, and just be yourself!",1
This is one of the best videos on the topic of interview tips that I’ve come across and I have been watching a ton of them! I’m going into one of the most important interviews of my life tomorrow and feel confident that if I stick to this script I will land this job. I’ll keep you guys posted.😊,1

"This video brought me back to my last IELTS speaking test. I didn't do as well as I was expected. Wish I had seen this video earlier back then. Thank you Rachel, I really enjoy learning through your videos.",1
"For non-natives, this lesson is very useful. In Argentina we are very used to having interviews in English, and you always have to prepare to do your best. Thank you Rachel!",1
"Rachel, thanks for sharing such a stunning job interview with us, which will help us get prepared and be more confident for a job interview. 🌹❤️",1
"This is a top-notch video about the typical English interview!😎👍 I wonder if they read a script or not, but even if they had done it, it's very smoothly delivered and the connective speech between them was not a problem at all.
Interestingly enough, we can bump into the questions they used in my country, Korea. In the last few months, I joined several face-to-face job interviews and they were not much different from one another. Very well done.!",1
"Thank you again Rachael !   Interviews are always a challenge.  I have often contemplated how I should behave while being interviewed.  It seems that the most successful interview experiences for myself have been ones where I remained relaxed but alert, and most important,  just be myself  .  If you are acting, it will tell on you and be unfavorable.  The person you are talking to is not God, just another person.  Keep that in mind during the interview process.  Always be respectful and honest.  I always enjoy listening to you Rachel no matter what you talk about because your diction is near perfect.",1
"Thank you Rachel, this is really helpful. You’re great!",1
"Hi Rachel, how are you.
Thank you for sharing your invaluable knowledge with us.
Thank you for sharing these great job interview tips. This video is going to help a lot of people including native speakers.
Your videos are just perfect.
P.s I heard that you used the prhase ""a little bit"", I had heard some natives that this is wrong, since ""little"" and ""bit"" means the same thing and it sounds like repetition.
I like to use it ""a little bit"". It sounds fun but some times I feel a little bit uncomfortable thinking if it is correct to use it or not, but if you use it here on a job interview, I know it is correct.😊",1
What a great channel!,1
"Tell Me About Yourself - Job Interview
 -Mr. Davis is ready to interview now.
 - thank you
 -hello Mr Torrus, nice to meet you. 
 i'm tom Davis, the manager of LCI software. 
 -nice to meet you Mr Davis
-first i'd like to congratulate you on passing our aptitude test. 
you did very well. 
-thank you.
-so, how did you hear about this job?
-i saw an advertisement online. 
i clicked on it 
and it brought me to your company's website, 
where i applied for it.
-makes sense.
what do you know about our company so far?
-i've read on your website 
that for over 10 years LCI software has delivered professional services.
on software development projects for clients all over the world.
i can tell from the pictures and client testimonials on the website that you do great, 
quality work. 
-yes, we always try to do quality work. 
the software products we build help many brands transform their businesses.
So, tell me about yourself. 
-i completed a Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Biology 
and a Master's Degree in Environmental informatics. 
i managed to get a job in the environmental engineering industry.
but i soon realized i wasn't cut out for that job 
and decided to move to a different industry.
i decided to take the path of a software developer.
-wow, what determined you to make such a bold career shift?
-i've had a great enthusiasm for technology since an early age.
i've always loved computers and gadgets and enjoyed building them and taking them apart.
i took online courses endorsed by high-profile universities and studied how to code. 
i have a few official software certificates.
i started by building websites for people i knew. 
it helped me build a portfolio of projects.
i got my first IOS development job at a software agency called tech services.
i had the opportunity to learn more about the software- building process there.
But, since there were not too many projects at that agency, 
after two years i decided to look for another job.
i soon started to work at an international startup company, Soft Solutions. 
it was a good chance to join a team. 
i've been able to use my training and experience fully at this company.
i gained experience in many things like teamwork, 
time management and quick decision making.
-how long have you been working for Soft Solutions?
-i've been working there for three years.
-why do you want to leave that job?
-i'm looking for a company where i can contribute more and grow. 
i'm ready to take the next step of my career.
-what exactly made you apply for this job at our company?
-i can see that your company has much future growth potential. 
i would love to grow my career at a company 
that has a great reputation in the software industry.
-what are your strengths? 
-my strengths are persistence and courage. 
i give my all to achieve my goals in spite of any hardships 
i might encounter along the way. 
i have a hard working nature. 
i'm always looking for ways to improve and grow. 
i'm also a great team player.
-can you provide an example of how you acted as a team player?
-i always tried to help my teammates complete their tasks if i had completed mine.
whenever someone needed to leave earlier, i would offer to cover for them. 
i'm willing to do whatever it takes for the team or company to succeed.
-great! 
so... what would you do if you didn't get on with someone on your team?
i would try to sort things out in a calm and rational manner. 
i would do my best to get on with that person for the sake of the team.
-what are your weaknesses? 
i can be a bit too straightforward at times and sometimes that hurts people.
but i'm working on this, and try to stop myself from being overly direct.
-where do you see yourself in five years?
-in five years, i'd like to be seen as someone with deep expertise in software development.  
i hope to be offered the opportunity to take the lead on some projects.
-there are definitely promotion opportunities at our company, 
depending on your achievements and expertise.
do you work well under pressure?
-usually i don't panic and manage to maintain self-control. 
there were many tight deadlines and stressful situations at my previous jobs.
i always put in extra hours and did my best in meeting the needs of the clients.
i've always delivered high quality work and respected my deadlines.
-interesting... 
can you tell me about a recent accomplishment or success you had?
i was part of the team that built the Louis kitchen app.
with this app, it's easy to order your favorites, even when you're on the go.
i love creating something that people can interact with and enjoy.
-that's quite impressive, i must admit.
okay, thanks so much for coming in, Mr Torrus. 
it was great to meet you. 
-it was great to meet you too.
-i'll give you a call tomorrow. 
-sounds good. i look forward to it. thank you.
-hello. 
-hello. this is Tom Davis the, manager of LCI software.
am i speaking to Mark Torrus? 
-yes, this is Mark Torres speaking.
-great. 
i'm calling to inform you that your interview was successful and i'd like to offer you the job.
-thank you,  i'd love to take the job.
when would you like me to start?",1
"This is not only an English teaching channel, it goes beyond that.  Keep up the great work!",1
I found this lesson really absorbing.  How explicitly this video illustrates the key points to be borne in mind in an interview! Most advantageous lesson I've ever watched.  Thanks to the entire team.,1
"I appreciate all your efforts to represent these videos , I can't find words to describe how professional you are , thank you so much",1
"Nossa, gostei muito do vídeo de hoje. Principalmente por terem colocado o glossário ao final. Muito bom mesmo! 🇧🇷🙏🏻👍🏻😁",1
"Wow, great narration and ease to understand. Concise statement and help us to apply it. Thank you very much for this short video. God bless. Hopefully I can make it by tomorrow. 🙏😊",1
"This video was excellent and gave me a lot of useful tips to prepare myself to an interview, thank you so much!",1
"That's a nice interview ,so i can learn more about this and apply it into my lesson.Thanks you so much!!!😊❤",1
"I used Dan’s exact script. I wrote everything down and practiced for a few days before my interview and when it came I nailed it! I could see it in the interviewer’s eyes. Once I ended by asking ‘is this along the lines of what you’re looking for?’, it was game over. Got offered the job less than 24 hours later and higher salary than what I expected. Thank you Dan! You taught a man to fish.",1
"I used this script exactly the way Sifu worded it. Many of my interviewers commented on this and they appreciated the clarity and conciseness I offered them with this one answer. And it was because of following his advice, I am able to sign my job offer letter as we speak. Thank you so much, Sifu. You are more impactful than you think.",1
"This was the first question that I was asked on my first interview, I jotted down what you said and added a few sentences, I got my second interview, I browsed again on your videos to prep and 2 days later I was offered the position! Thank you so much!!!!",1
"Earlier this week, I was called for an interview. Due to scheduling issues, I had my interview the very next day via Zoom (barely 15 hours prior notice). I used this video as well as his other interview videos to prepare. This was the first time I felt confident in responding to ""tell me about yourself."" The interviewer even told me ""very nice"" after I said my spiel as outlined in the video (I didn't end with the question because I'm not THAT confident 😂). At the conclusion of the interview, they told me I wouldn't know a decision until 2 weeks later, but they ended up offering me the position two DAYS later. Thank God I found this video!! I'm extremely grateful 😊",1
"Got a interview today in 15 minutes wish me luck 🤓
Edit: I got the job 🤩",1
"Thank you Dan Lok. Since I used this script of yours, I received positive responses from the interviews I had. Now I enjoy collecting and choosing which employer I'll invest my time and skills. This video and your script so powerful. Uplifted me to proceed in my search when I was on the verge of quitting.",1
"Hello Dan,  great informative video. I have been learning a lot with your channel videos. This information gave me so much clarity, I tend to get very nervous on interviews. These videos have been very useful to me, for which I strongly recommend him and will take Dan especially into account in my future consultations. Thanks a lot for such good stuff.",1
A few years ago it hit me that job interviewing is like a first date and working is like being in a relationship in a sense. Thinking of it that way I began to realize the error of my ways. This is an excellent video. Thank you so much. I cannot tell you how many good job opportunities I messed up when I was younger just on the “tell me about yourself” question.,1
Danny DeVito is so pure that it seems like he put hand sanitizer all over his body,1
I was having a bad day  but this brought me a lot of joy!!! Danny Devito is just precious! He always makes me laugh! ❤,1
"We are fortunate to have Danny DeVito answering some questions, dude's a living legend 😎",1
I want to protect Danny DeVito at all cost! This man is a national treasure.,1
"Danny DeVito, a walking testament that heart and cutting edge creativity will always prevail over looks and physical stature.",1
"Absolutely love Danny DeVito, such a fantastic actor! So likeable as well!",1
He's just one of those people who's nailed life. Could watch him all day. (not in a weird way or anything ... urgh),1
him constantly pulling the wrong papers was so funny lmao,1
"Saweetie has such a calming demeanor and soothing voice. She seems like such a genuinely kind person. Also, Kevin Hart did such an incredible job digging deeper after each question because he truly wanted to know her story! He asks great questions. Love how vulnerable this convo was.",1
"I can tell that she struggles with being vulnerable, because I do, too. 😂 Love that she's focusing on herself and her mental health.",1
She’s actually well spoken . I like how she conducts herself in interviews,1
"Classy, well-spoken, intelligent, sassy, educated, business mindset, artistic, beautiful soul, great artistry, and aesthetically beautiful — she’s the full package.",1
"Saweetie is SO well spoken and truly confident in every way. The way she covers her mouth when she laughs is honestly the cutest, most giddy trait she has lol. Her authenticity is why she is where she is today and why she will only go up from here! 💞💞",1
"I really love her and think that she doesn't deserve all this hate. she's working on herself, on her music, and her career so it's sad to see that people always find to say something bad. amazing interview which once again convinced me that Ssweetie is one of the cutest and most down-to-earth celebrities🫶🏻",1
I love that her parents apologized for the childhood they gave her. My dad can’t even admit to the bad childhood he gave me.,1
Her immediately saying “I know that’s right” 😂😂😂 love her!,1

"Mark, thank you for the content that you bring us, it makes me appreciate how I was raised by my parents and will be forever grateful for their sacrifices.",1
"I am the softest bleeding heart you'll ever find, but when I hear about this guy killing and maiming innocent people who were just going to work, I really don't give a shit that he has PTSD. I have zero sympathy. It's one thing to beat up some guy who's in the racket, but it's another thing entirely when a guy who needs to pay the rent goes to work and gets shot by some tough guy yokel. Fuck that. .",0
This is an excellent interview. It gives hope for anyone who wishes to change their lives. Thank you to John for being so honest. I wish him  luck on his road to redemption.,1
"What a roller coaster of emotions hearing your story. I’m amazed at who you have become and at your journey. What happened in your past is certainly horrific however, your passion for being better and perpetuating positivity is all we can hope for from all people in society. There might be hope for this world🥹🙏🏽",1
"I love when a natural story teller is interviewed. Sometimes,  Mark will ask one question and an uninterrupted retelling of a life follows. I  so quickly became mesmerized in this tale of the streets, that I cannot even remember if an opening question was presented. This is a beautiful thing.  Thank you, Mark and John, for sharing.",1
"Wow, this whole interview was done in one take with no interruption. Captivating stuff,  thanks Mark.",1
"I must thank you for sharing this John, I had my nephew who was leading down the wrong path watch this as well. He looked up to so many of the  wrong ""street guys"" in the neighborhood who seemed to continue this life. He watched and listened, read your  books and came to the best conclusion that living to learn is better than not living at all, thank you sir.",1
"You can appreciate the great transformation this man has made along his journey through and away from a violent path towards one of great meaning and value offering guidance to the youth of today based on his own past life experiences.

The openness and honesty on display here is admirable, as is the bravery to tell his story and fully embrace the opportunity to give back and evolve positively towards an ever brighter future strengthening not only himself but offering that solid support, strength and dependability also outwardly to help and guide others.",1
"Thank you, Childish Gambino for helping me get a job.",1
I’m already nervous by watching this,0
"Practice is key!  Know the most common interview questions,  drill them over and over (until you're sick of hearing your own voice) and know exactly how to connect your experience directly to the job description of the job you're applying to. Good luck to everyone with an upcoming interview!",1
"I am watching this because I just found out today that I will be interviewed for a position volunteering at a library. I am fourteen, and, of course, this isn't a real job, but I think that this will be a good experience for me, to be able to get a taste of what a real job interview looks like. These are some fantastic tips, and now I feel much more prepared. :D",1
"I'm just way too uncomfortable and anxious in an interview, and it's frustrating because I'm not like that once I'm working. I'm always prepared, but the interview of course ends up being nothing I prepared for. I had a situational interview today (I didn't know it would be only situational) for a school.. and they asked me how I would react to a school shooting situation. I was like..... surprised inside, but outside stayed calm because that's important. I get why they're asking, but I'm like, lock the doors and make sure the kids are secured? Who knows how I did. I actually had a question about their safety protocols on my list, but decided I wasn't going to ask it because it seemed inappropriate.. so it surprised me when they said it first. I asked it in an interview at a hospital and they were very impressed that I was thinking ahead. I'm in the USA if you didn't already guess that. 2 interviews where the topic of a mass shooting situation came up -- and no, they weren't security jobs. I don't even care, really. I'm finishing my 2nd novel and finding myself an agent, then a cabin in the woods lol I can't take all this.",0
"i like the “pause” part, pause is so crucial in a conversation scenario thanks for the advice.",1
"""Pound for pound. Headshot *dead* ! There is no pound for pound. The belt belongs to no one.""- Leon Edwards
GSP was so right when he said ""The strongest man in the world is an illusion. If you win a fight, you were the best man on that particular day, in that particular location, at that particular moment. The belt is a symbol but it is an illusion. ""

No one is invincible, everyone is beatable. Everyone is human.",1
"The whole fight was like a movie. All his life's hardships led to that moment, father's murder, migrating to a roughest part of a different country, getting in trouble growing up, 3 years of harassment ( 3 peice and soda), almost losing that title shot opportunity on the last round against Diaz, fighting the main boss in Usman, the commentators being 100% sure that he'll lose, his coaches screaming ""don't feel sorry for yourself"", down to the final round, everyone sure he is not winning it, and.........💥boom💥headshot. The whole arena cheered and  blew the roof off. What a story!!!",0
“Little old Leon came in with one shot and head kicked him” savage yet humble line 🔥🔥🔥,1
"This is beyond fighting, beyond the championship. This was great for the world, for society. What Leon did shows you sometimes you are at your lowest in life and you may want to give up, but you keep going and make the impossible happen. Thank you Leon!",1
"I can honestly say I have never felt so connected and part of a UFC World Title winner in the decades I have been watching MMA. His story and personality just draws you in and to be a part of it as a fan and spectator, truly living one of the greatest moments in MMA history.",1
"This man right here had just accomplished the IMPOSSIBLE. While everyone was chasing clout and jumping on bandwagons for the past couple of years, Leon has always remained true to himself and his values and it has definitely PAID OFF. CONGRATULATIONS LEON🙌",1
"3 days after this all unfolded and I'm still searching for interviews with Leon and highlights of the fight and the post fight interview. Speaks volumes of how special that moment was. Long time UFC fan, and this is right up there for me.",1
The world needs more people like Leon. Great interview!,1
When Leon was talking about his mom and how he made her proud and cried.... the feels... I love this guy..,1
Such raw emotion from Leon. You can see how much all of this means to him. All that hard work and sacrifice is coming out.,1
Hello Richard! I don’t usually make YouTube comments but now I feel like I should. Before knowing this channel I was failing every single one of my interviews. After your videos and content I started passing them and I got 2 job offers. Thank you so much for your service. It was life changing for me. 🙏,1
"Thank you for your solid, no frills, ‘right to the heart of it’ videos!  I will definitely tell others who are in job-hunting mode. 
I watched your videos for the past two days (over and over). I had my second interview (virtual) and was offered the job (with a US airline)before the interview ended. 😃
Thank you again!",1
You’re interview packet that I purchased from your website helped me study for a interview I had on Friday. I got the job! I start in January. Your material was worth the money.,1
Wonderfully structured answers for common questions. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us. Fingers crossed to all applicants and good luck with the interviews :) I have a few myself :),1
"Thank you so much for your videos. Had an interview today at 1pm and got the job an hour ago. I binged watched like 5 of your videos prior to the interview. Before describing myself in 3 words, I said thank you for this opportunity 😂 and the interviewer smiled. I was like yes! aha 😄",1
I had my interview today and it went well after listening to your video yesterday. She asked several questions that you addressed. Thank you for your help. 🙏🏼,1
"Hi Richard, I just want to thank you for putting these videos out.  I watched and studied them.  I  picked up many Tips and words to use in my interview.  I received a job offer with a major airline.  I am so glad that I put in the time and effort to study your videos.  I thank you for putting them out there.  Please keep up the great work.",1
"Hi Richard. Don’t know if you will ever read this but I have to express my gratitude towards you. 
I came across your videos a year ago after the pandemic not only lost In my career but lost in myself. 
Little did I know how much impact you would have on my life. 
I found myself motivated, more knowledgeable and confident to approach a job interview with just GCSEs to me name at late 20s in a competitive environment and not only did I secure a financial operations Interview but I have now just secured a promotion upon studying this interview just 10 months later.
I have learnt so much from you, but the most important lesson I’ve learnt is to install that self confidence in yourself because no matter what degree you have if you can’t sell it, it won’t work. 
Much love and keep up the good work and I hope to meet you one day 🙌",1

You make successful interviewing easy to digest, understand, but most importantly, PUT INTO ACTION! Thanks to you I’ve officially broken into the accounting/finance industry!",1
"I am literally going to comment on every video you have and I’m going to send you an email to personally thank you, this video literally changed my life and changed how I will approach interviews going forward. I had a big interview with a big company that was four hours long with four different people in one day. Me already having my stories written down in the STAR method, making sure I said I in everything and having my stats on how I helped my previous Company gave me the confidence I needed to answer any questions that they needed. I was also able to dissect my stories to answer other questions that they needed this method is so bullet proof. I received a call yesterday that I got the job and I’m so happy I cannot thank you enough.",1
I GOT THE JOB!!! Thank you so much.,1
"My wife and I watched dozens of your videos during her job search. Thanks to your hard work and insights, she landed her dream job — and nearly doubled her salary. Your videos changed our lives. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!",1
"I used your toolbox to nail my interview, I used your follow up email to get the ball moving on a response (and got a job offer an hour after sending it) and now I used your ""Salary Expectations"" video to negotiate a higher salary. I'm beyond greatful! thank you!",1
I got the job!!!! I went through a grueling 3-round interview process and made the switch to a new industry into a position I am beyond excited about. I was watching your videos and applying ALL your tips continually throughout my interview process. Thank you!!!,1
"Went without a job for over a year. Put in a lot of applications and got some interviews, but would not end up getting hired. Watched some of your videos over the past 2 weeks and now landed a job offer with almost +$20K than my previous job. Thank you SO MUCH!",1
"Thank you! This is probably the best career advise I've ever heard and I'm 54. I have an interview on Tuesday for my dream job which is a field that I have limited experience in. I do have a lot of career success stories, but I've never written them down and I tend to draw a blank when I'm nervous. I look forward to listening to more of your videos and checking out your website.",1
I got accepted into radiology school! I had a 33% of getting in and I nailed that interview because of you;) forever thankful for you and your resources,1
"I feel like I always prepare so much but still draw blanks because I am so nervous. I have an interview in 15 mins and I’m trying to calm down
Edit: I got the job!!!",0
"Interviews should be changed to ""get-to-know you"" meets. People will be totally chill if you could talk in person in some cafe or a restaurant. 
Introverts should be given a chance too 😭",1
"I'm in HR and do recruiting, and I myself am nervous during interviews and it's hilarious! That's why when I'm interviewing others, I just wish I could tell them hey, it's fine, you're doing great! And when I'm interviewing, I wish I could just listen to my own words of advice!",1
I tried these tips and many other interview questions that you taught i was offered a job the same day thank you so much you are life saver I have been unemployed for a long time and after 8 unsuccessful interviews my 9th interview was successful and landed me my first job thanks to you.. God bless you ❤️❤️,1
"I think over time, as you get more experience and have done quite a few interviews, you'll just naturally start to feel more relaxed. Another thing I like to think about before an interview that calms me down a bit is that it's not the end of the world if you don't get the job. You'll still be ok, there'll be another place.",1
"I’m here to calm my nerves. I’ll be having an interview in like 45 minutes.

Edit: I got the job!",1
"Love these tips! Being confident in interviews is so hard. Mainly because we are so hard on ourselves and the stakes are high! The #1 tip about being comfortable in the space is HUGE. Being present helps you get out of your head and stop any spiraling before it starts. Visualizing beforehand was mentioned, but it can be a total game changer. By visualizing yourself answering the questions and killing it in the interview, your brain will be trained for that scenario.",1
Heartwarming to read the comments and see that the public is not buying the BS.,0
Thanks jimmy for making more republicans your truly are a hero,1
"I absolutely loved it when Joe Biden said ""it's Biden Time"". Really wrapped the interview together.",1
Props for having the guts to leave the comments section enabled. I knew right away it was gonna be wild lol,1
"I've never heard the audience sound so trained. They must genuinely love what he's saying. I know when he says something good when they roar up in applause and immediately go silent ever so naturally, because otherwise I have no idea.",1
The fact that y’all voted for this man is unbelievable,0
The dislike ratio of this video is very telling. Love it.,1
"Great lesson! Thank you! One of the things that has made me succeed at interviews is answering at a relaxed pace and honestly as much as possible. Of course a well-nourished resume helps enormously, but speaking with humility and truthfully about yourself is a remarkable addition.",1
"This lesson was very useful for me, thank you so much Anne Marie. I’m currently looking for a job as an architect in DC and this lesson brought me an overview of what can I expect. Thanks again. Since approximately one year ago I’ve been watching your videos. These really have helped me a lot to improve my English skills. 💯👌🏼",1
"Hi Annemarie, thank you for your masterclass. I found it very useful. However, I am just an incoming college student and I am preparing for a college interview. I’m having trouble with how am I going to answer confidently those possible questions that will be going to ask to me. English isn’t my first language but I’m willing enough to learn. I’ve been watching your videos on Youtube and subscribed to your channel. I admire you a lot because you’re helping many students like me that had trouble and difficulties in the English language. I am looking for guides on exactly what to do and how to answer the possible college interview questions. I hope you can help me to reach my dream college and to be more steps ahead of my fellow applicants/candidates.


Thank you so much and more power to you.",1
"Great video. There seems to be a gap in these employment videos, no one seems to focusing or making videos geared towards parents returning to the work force after raising kids. I wish there were more videos like that.",1
Thank you. I find the following interview questions a bit uncomfortable: 1) How do you deal with difficult people 2) Insisting on knowing the salary (which is not nice),0
"incidentally, i find that your video has the subtitle generating by cell phone automatically; due to curiosity, i check the consistency between the subtitles and Annie's speech and surprisingly i find that they are highly consistent. it's revealed that Annie has crystal clear, highly correct, and very fluent speech quality. that's awesome and i appreciate the way she teach.",1
Your manner of  teaching grabbed my attention immediately . You are like a breath of fresh air for me!,1
"This lesson is really helpful  for me, so I want to know if there's another one on how to prepare a resume in english. Thanks in advance, Anne Marie.",1
It’s very hard to make my English in the flow while I am nervous. But your tips help me so much. Thank you!,1

"My interview is August 30th I don’t know  what the out come will be, can someone wish me good luck?  I’m a bit nervous.",0
"I studied these questions over and over..and I was so confident during the interview....
Starting my dream job this week ❤️",1
"I really really wanted this job. 
I watched your videos and did my homework as well as I could. 
During the 2 hours interview I was well prepared, confident and did my best. 
Thank you so much Don!
I start my dream job in August!",1
"I studied Don's interview questions and did my own research. I had my interview today at 1, I got the job offer 3 hours later.
Thank you, Tom! Keep up the good work",1
"Thank you so much, Don! I watched this video numerous times and studied your teachings like crazy, and I could tell by the employer's facial expressions that he was very impressed by my instantaneous responses and research into the company, and I was pretty much offered the position on the spot! 7/38/55!!!!!!!",1
"I just want to share that these tips helped me land my dream job. Fresh out of college as an engineer, I did great during a phone interview, but poorly in a face-to-face invterview for a fortune 500 company. I just didn't have pre-planned topics to answer some questions with and came off as unprepared and inexperienced. I didn't get the job then. 5 years later,  I wanted to redeem myself. This was a once in a lifetime job opportunity for me so I didn't want to miss my chance. I had a 30 minute interview with the executive director of engineering and was able to hit on all of my strengths clearly and concisely. I nailed it. I started by highlighting key aspects of the job posting, and then I thought about all of these interview questions and practiced my responses daily until they came out naturally. It landed me the job!",1
"Interview at a bank tomorrow. Customer service. Pays almost double what I get now. I have 6 pages written down of my answers and will be practicing tonight. Thank you so much for these!!!!

edit: Got the Job offer 4 hours after my interview. I now work at one of Canada's top 5 banks. THANK YOU SO MUCH! I felt much more confident with all these questions I prepared for.",1
"Big corporate management interview coming up tomorrow and this was so helpful! As someone who has a  bit of mileage, I had an idea of the direction I wanted to go but this really solidified and guided me! This was amazing and so are you! Thank you thank you!!! 🥰🙏🏽",1
"This is just perfect and works everytime. The way you speak in confidence and relaxed manner reflected on me. You have directed my mindset to the right path even if I am not really confident, at least I feel that I am giving satisfactory answers. 

Just passed my interview with 2 hiring managers after only watching this video. Thank you !",1
"They way bro talks has me dying 😭 ""fLEXing STacks of CASh""",0
People don’t understand there’s blood on the beef they can’t just let it go it’s sadly a countinuing cycle,0
The whispers got me weak bruh 😂😂,0
"Boy telling a horror story 💀😂

✍️:Appreciate the love gang",1
"Durk dropped ""aah ha"" first and yb responded with ""I Hate YoungBoy"" in less then 24 hours . Get your facts together .",0
"I appreciate you, Durk. I pray you find peace and can just focus on your beautiful fiance, kids and career. RIP to Von also.",1
"Not even kidding, I had a flat tire and the guy from the company rolled up looking pretty close to this. I almost peed my pants. He saw my reaction and I can tell you he was one of the kindest people I have ever encountered. He said you should see people’s reaction when I have to change tires at night.I am grateful the company gave him a job and a chance.  He turned his life around and was doing something for his kids. I gave him the fattest tip and I’m truly blessed that we had that encounter. 
I hope this guy stays on the right track, too!",1
"It’s amazing how you can see some people’s souls come alive when they are given a chance to share their story where there’s no judgement, just a genuine desire to allow them to speak their truth.",1
"Spent the first seven years of my career teaching Florencia 13 gangbangers in Huntington Park, Ca. They were middle  schoolers and spent the better part of the day trying to keep their pants up. But as tough as they wanted you to believe they were, most of them were just babies trying to fit in. Then I moved to a high school and stayed in touch with two who went in different directions. One is now a Highway Patrol officer. The other was murdered by his cousin at the direction of a rival gang. To this day, I feel more affection than fear for these lost souls.",0
"At some moments I was smiling with him, and others I was terrified. 
A wonderful interview. Thank you for giving so many interesting people a platform to tell their story.",1
"Baldacci, thank you for accepting this interview. I appreciate your genuine honesty and acknowledgment of your past. I feel your strength and kindness. Real talk. Bless you man",1
"My first experience with gangs was working in a hospital and having a patient come in with severe trauma from a motorcycle accident. He looked much like this guy, tattooed from head to toe with his gang numbers and multiple scars from stabbings and gun shots. The guy didn't make it and when we called the family to tell them he was dying his mother's reply was ""he brought this upon himself with the life he was living"", no one showed up through his dying process. I ended up sitting with him after my shift was over until he passed. In the end,  I didn't care what he had done in his life I just wanted him to know someone cared for him regardless. 
My best to Baldacci, it sounds like he has people who love him and that's what matters ❤️",0
"It's interviews like this that remind me every day that if I'm going in with preconceived judgement about a person, I'm being an asshole. This guy is so well spoken and can tell that he can definitely put his good intentions into a powerful direction. He should take up writing so he can tell his story.",0
Man he is so well spoken and I love being able to hear a different perspective on gang members and being able to see the human in all of us even through the tattoo and his past etc.,1
"I truly enjoyed this interview. I gave us a window to see this man soul and the work that he's doing to change his life.
We're quick to judge people based on their looks but if we're able to get past that we can discover that this people are just human like any of us. They had little to no choice about their lifestyle but once they break the cycle I actually feel good for them.",1
He’s amazingly insightful and reflective considering the life he chose and the things he’s done.  A man of paradox in so many ways.,1
"Hello Sir Richard, just to let you know that.... I GOT THE JOB!! Mission accomplished thank you so much for all the videos and the work you put up, it made all the difference in my case.",1
Great news! I passed my 2nd interview yesterday and got an offer letter by email today even though I was told it would take a few days or up to a week to hear back. This was made possible by watching your videos and how to answer the possible interview questions that would come up in a way that would set me apart from other candidates and employing the STAR technique when answering some of the questions instead of just giving a closed ended response. BTW I have already subscribed to your channel. Many thanks for your valuable advice!,1
"I just wanted to say a big thank you to you Richard, for all your interview tips and preparation materials.  I am from Australia.  I recently got promoted as ICT Delivery Manager.  Not only for just interview, your materials are helping me with my job as well.  I recommended your channel to all my family and friends.  Thanks again and please continue the good work 🙏🏼😍",1
"I just want to say thank you so much for you truly inspirational videos, your interview tips and tricks have not only have made me more confident in interviews it has helped massively with my self esteem, i left a job in oct of 11 years and took a fixed term contract hoping they would take me on permanently but unfortunately due to covid they introduced a recruitment freeze so i have been an anxious mess trying to find a job and landed two job offers one of them being my dream job as a project manager! Thank you Richard keep up this anazing content!! 🥰🥰",1
"Hi Richard thank you for your tutorials.I passed my interview last Friday April 01 2022.
Am happy I found your website.
Please continue posting as you are a blessings for others",1
"Outstanding sir Richard. I will have an interview next week, your videos assisting me a lot. Pray for my interview and secure the job afterwards. Thank you",1
"More great content as always! I watched a TON of your stuff, and recently started my best job ever in my career 2 weeks ago, and your content def helped me pass. Thank you for what you do!",1
"Thank you sir Richard! 
I cannot thank enough for all your tutorials here. My first round interview went quite good and all thanks to you big-time. 🤗",1
"Thank you so much for making these videos. Your videos gave me the confidence I needed in an interview. I was so nervous to have a interview in a research management position, but your videos helped to calm me down and give me the confidence and the answers to help me get the job. I was hired on the spot. Thank you again!",1
Damn.  This was a great interview.  So much respect for the quality and depth of the questions Adam comes up with.,1
Adam kills me when he puts all of his great journalistic interviewing skills into people outside of his sphere yet back at the No Jumper office he just talks in circles about nonsense 😂,0
Dan is the one guy that can make Adam look innocent,1
"Not the biggest fan of Dan, but this was definitely the best interview he's done IMO.  You killed this Adam... You've improved an INSANE amount since the beginning days, it's nuts.",1
"Adam really is becoming a top tier interviewer. He was asking some great questions. I personally don't like dan that much, but I can't lie to myself and act like Dan's life isn't fascinating. Great interview.",1
"This was a great interview with Dan. Excellent topics and went the perfect amount of depth into each topic. I know people don't like him much, but this was a great interview with him.",1
Dan's been shady and whatnot but his chemistry here with Adam resulted in an awesome conversation. Props to both.,1

"""I think we killed them.""
""Huh. Ya don't say.""
Caught me off guard.",0
"for people that dont understand it, we all know afton hates being in the suit because its infinite suffering. if they kill him he gets to rest peacefully and they dont want that because he needs to pay by suffering until the world ends or something.",0
"I like how the Bonnies seem to be the most aware and conscious, with Toy Bonnie just acting like a normal dude",1
"6:03 i like how he see's them as friends ""ah guys whats happened to you?""",1
I love how all the Bonnie's are generally polite and aren't just out for the kill.,1
"2:08
Can we all just appreciate how HUGE the animatronics are? Foxy himself is probably 7' 5!",1
"God, the voice actors did an such amazing job; the voices fit the characters so well! I love Withered Bonnie's one",1
"They way foxy comforted freddy brought a tear to my eye. ""It's alright, we can rest now..friends forever.""",1
Im  a Black Woman and I love the Human Race!  I love Diversity. We all are unique and wonderfully made. I Love You All😢❤️,1
"This guy really just said ""people are too judgemental"" haha",0
"English is not my first language, so maybe I misunderstood some things he said. But I truely respect, that he is so brave to defend his lifestyle as a gay sorcerer, no matter what other people think about it.",1
I think socially awkward young men who don’t have friends and have no real skills or education tend to be drawn into cults like this because it gives them a chance to belong to something. This guy is a shining example of that.,0
"This dude contradicts himself multiple times…sometimes within the same sentence lol but you can see the being in the kkk has wrecked his life more than anything. This dude lost the love of his life and it’s still very obvious that he is in love with her and misses her. But his own beliefs make it impossible for them to be together. He knows that love is love. Says love sees no color, but then says race mixing is wrong lol I think his heart speaks the truth and then what’s been brainwashed comes out. That’s why he contradicts himself so much.",0
"To see a grown man, dressed in this weird outfit, playing judge and juror, assuming that he has the ability to fix society just based on his color....is a sad state of affairs. We are in trouble.",0
"His views on racism and bigotry were honestly fascinating, i would really love to look at this guys memories and see how exactly he developed these opinions and what paths his life took",1
This interview was so insightful. NLE is really ahead of his time. The part where he talked about feeling stuck hit on a different level. Thank you for being inspiring! 🙏🏾,1
I don't have enough time to explain the new found respect that I have for this young man! Much respect!💯💪🏿✊🏿❤️,1
"This young man is dropping Gems. Very Genuine&, Candid I pray God continues to order his steps and cover him.",1
I got respect for NLE for this right here.,1
"As an educator working in the last stop inner city Pittsburgh high school, there aren't words to express my appreciation for this interview. We are using herbs, chakras, crystals, energy, food, and entrepreneurship and it's dope AF to hear all it in this interview. 'Cause it's been tough.

 NLE Choppa just lept to the top of my list and I didn't know who we was before today. That song Bryson. That. There. We need more young folks like this... The Divine awakening after shedding the armor of darkness that served so well in the development of the strength necessary in these times. The Gods on Earth awaken.",1
"I really really like this kid. He makes me smile. Super mature for his age. 

Vlad you handled that really gracefully. You & the kid had a great interview. Thank you for good entertainment. Grown man shit.",1
Everyone that’s watching this inspirational and Motivational interview going through the Struggle/Pain hang in there i wish y’all Health Wealth Prosperity and Blessings,1
Damn ..I didnt know this young man was soo bright ..very talented ..never heard his music ..but if he talks like this I can imagine ..ima go take a listen after this interview 💯💯🙏🏿,1
"He said ""man to man"" like he ain't got security close by 🤣🤣🤣 stop it vlad",0
This guy is great.. I hope he continues on his path and stays away from trouble.,1
I love her accent....who else???,1
i could listen to her talk all day. even if it was just her reading the dictionary,1
"I love how she's confident enough to put forth her views about the current issues and struggles of women and how she's able to relate to and understand them and then throw light on what the world has probably been doing wrong and comment on that. All of her thoughts and ideas and opinions are so down to earth and genuine that they just touch your heart and I really appreciate her efforts of making this world a better place to live in by promoting valuable projects and regenerating the idea of gender equality amongst the youth and the older generation as well. So, good job. :)",1
"I was looking for ""Understanding British accent"", I am glad YouTube recommended me this. Her accent is beyond beautiful. She is intelligent too.",1
"I just happened to stumble upon this interview. Emma is beyond well spoken. She is highly intelligent, sweet and real. I look up to her so much. I'll always be a huge fan!",1
"It's awesome to see such a young woman with this effort to change the world. The hate that flows on the comments below just shows how deep her argument are going, disturbing those who feels personally offended by women with this behavior in face of life. And this is great, because this hatefull coments shows people's face, people who is hided behind a keyboard and that needs to be seen, so that the good ones can target them and avoid unreasonable discussions. Thanks, Emma!",1
Emma's interviews are so great and helpful in English learning🐝 she's so intelligent and just adorable! One of the best actresses of this century✨,1
Her mind is so beautifully inspiring.,1
Semra is absolutely brilliant. She needs to be on regularly during transfer windows. You go girl!,1
"Hadn’t seen an interview with her before but what quality, insight and delivery. Excellent interview Stretford!",1
"Semra - I'm a long time Real Madrid fan and your analysis of Casmiro's game is probably the best I've heard in 10 years - both of his strenghts and the areas one might call 'weaknesses' - it was perfect, and I would add that both Zidane and Ancellotti held him in the same high regard - I hope we don't live to regret losing him too soon.  We need you on main stream TV more...",1
The channel has been getting some very good guests on recently. Well done folks.,1
Semera is a gem! Spanish football are lucky to have a pundit like her. Puts the English ones to shame,1
"If Casimero signed for Pool.or City everyone would say it's a great signing but because it's United all they just want to do is have a go.
In Ten Hag we trust.",1
"Love these interviews from people covering the teams. Great one again Joe, Semra.",1
"Always enjoy Semra, even when she’s covering LaLiga. The comment about McFred made my day 🤣",1
Haven't seen Elon this relaxed in an interview for quite a while. Good job guys!,1
Great jobs guys keeping him comfortable for 3 hours. I enjoyed this,1
So patient with these guys. I love how he answers the same question over and over until they all understand.,1
I love Elon's laugh. For someone to be at his status to have such a relaxed demeanor and sense of humor he is hilarious,1
"Watching this podcast I'm thinking to myself how these guys can ask the dumbest questions with the richest and one of the smartest man in the world. Then hearing Elon's response you realize how down to earth and almost child like he is, and it dawns upon you how incredible he is in the sense that he got to this point with sheer brilliance. No fake persona, no bs, nothing like any other billionaire. He is so ""normal"" that his brilliance must surpass anyone else on this planet to get to where he is today. Respect.",1
"Instantly classic. Love how Elon is super intelligent but still remains down to earth to have a conversation like this... he genuinely cares about the state of humanity, more than money. GREAT WORK guys!",1
I don’t why but I have the sensation that Elon is doing these kind of podcasts as another way of making bigger changes because he knows right now the majority of young people just see garbage on the internet and he being on this podcast is his way of putting his grain of salt to save humanity. What a great guy,1
"This was the most interesting thing I've ever watched. Questions I have myself were asked and Elon responded in a way we can all understand, even though it wouldv'e been dumbed down x10000 in his books hahaha. True legend.",1
"I love how literal Elon is, it's refreshing.  Interviewer when referring to mars travel:"" How many people can you fit on the Space Shuttle?"" Elon:  ""The Shuttle is not capable of going beyond earth.""",1
Refreshing to see a sober dude.. Adam and killing the interviews...,1
"Myyy man, I been listening to this guy since before he even had his own channel and his shit was posted on some account with a Chinese profile picture, feels hella good to see a rapper you’ve been listening to blow up so fast🙏🏽",1
"This is fucking legendary to watch

TO SEE OUR NAME GET SOME MORE EXPOSURE IS 🔥 AF",1
Props to Sleazy He surprised me hes highly Intelligent as well,1
Got chills when he was repping grand rapids Michigan!,1
Been looking forward for this interview. Sleazy that guy🔥🤝,1
Interesting and Chill asf🔥🔥Solid Interview,1
This is a fire interview,1
Ray J is something special he never disappoints!,1
"You know what's wild...when the episode first started playing, I was like ""aww man, this gone be a diva show""...then he started to unravel, made for some great moments...really why I love these interviews. You really can't help but be yourself & entertain what feels like a normal one on one convo. Marco is insanely talented at it! just creating a nice neutral space for every personality...love these!",1
"Man Ray never disappoints...""I don't feel virally!""",0
Ray j is entertaining he deserves a podcast or talk show for sure 😂,1
This episode felt like a trolling contest 😂😂😂,0
Lmaoooo honestly couldn’t even prank this man he’s just as funny and ready for whatever😂,1
Funniest interview by far. Ray J played his role 🙏,1
"This was really cool, I’m excited for it even more now",1
I have no doubt this game will be a blast to play. In MossBag I trust!,1
I've pledged to Titan Shell and Nara... i'm still hoping hard for Nara to make it.,1
It's so great to have you back my friend,1
Good interview :),1
If everyone that is subscribed to Relyea donated 1 dollar they would make double their goal. just saying.,1
very nice!,1
EXCUSE me no lobster talk?,0
RELYEA PLEASE play an awesome game called blasphemous,1
Your nose and stash look like a combo with your glasses,0
I see a 50 Cent interview and I watch immediately. 50 NEVER disappoints in his interviews.,1
"I have always loved 50 interviews. He drops knowledge like a great philosophy professor. He's always had a blueprint, a map, a plan since he first came into the game with his mixtapes. He drops gems on life, business, goals, etc. He's a marketing genius. No one can hold a candle to him when it comes to going from the bottom to the top and maintaining, while still recreating yourself and evolving as a businessman. Give this man his 🌹 roses while he's here, not after he's gone. He's one of my role models.",1
"That’s one of the best interviews I’ve seen recently in the hip hop space. There are so many Hip hop Podcasts now and most of them still don’t hit the way this interview hit with the amount of knowledge, business secrets & dealings, spoken in this interview! Applaud Envy & Ctgod on this piece! Respect",1
"50 is just a pivotal person who I repeatedly lock into throughout my life. He brings the knowledge, the hustle, the comedy, the motivation, the dominance, everything you need to hear to push further in your path",1
50 knows how to lead an interview and command respect in the room. His aura and energy is just different mixed with a wealth of knowledge/intelligence. All you have to do is sit back and listen with open ears. 🙏🏾,1
This is why the breakfast club is legendary. At any given moment a super legend will pull up and do a great interview.,1
"This made me respect 50 even more. His business acumen is so on point. I love that he's helping schools in Houston. He comes off as the bully of the block, but he's Ultimately giving people jewels and leaves it up to them to make jewelry. This man is constantly learning the business and taking over. Kudos and blessings to him.",1
50 is one of the few who has truly studied the industry for years and is now reaping what he has sown. Every time he interviews he drops jewels 💎 Hate him or love him but you gotta respect him.,1
"50 is just a pivotal person who I repeatedly lock into throughout my life. He brings the knowledge, the hustle, the comedy, the motivation, the dominance, everything you need to hear to push further in your path",1
"Man, to see dudes like 50 genuinely laughing and smiling like this and to know where they came from and how hip-hop changed their lives, is really amazing. The rap game is a blessing to the black community and it makes me wonder how some of these dudes could make it and still wanna be in crime, risking their lives and their freedom, when they could be out here living their best lives like 50.",1
"Say what ever you want, but Boosie is the epitome of a southern raised Black man. He has real qualities and he stands on it no matter what. It doesn’t matter if you white, black, brown, don’t matter with this man. Respect him and he’s respectful back. You don’t have to agree with everything the man says, but most of what he says is the real deal facts or the hard perspectives that many people aren’t comfortable talking about. Been a huge fan of Boosie through his whole career, I wish nothing but great things for him. As a Louisiana native, it gives us hope that one day that type of success can be achieved!",1
"Madd respect for Boosie, this man talks common sense and self respect. Need more like this man and many more men out here in this world!!!!!",1
"Hands down one of the best boosie interviews, he’s always keep in it real real 💯🔥",1
"These interviews are great with Boosie. They made me go back and listen to his music. Loved his songs, now i'm a fan!!!!",1
"I died when Boosie said "" I'm not finished ""🤣🤣🤣",0
How can you not like this man !!! He’s going to keep it 100 every time he opens his mouth,0
Boosie is so passionate about what he believes in and is very outspoken. He stands on his beliefs....  I admire his truth and how he puts logic on hot topics.  You can disagree to agree but you must respect his opinion because we all have them. Keep that truth coming Boosie BADAZZ.,1
"I really love this guy. Ain’t never listened to his music, but I can listen to him talk forever. I mean, he’s ten toes down on everything. No wavering. Boosie is the peoples champ, for real!",1
Boosie is one of the realest can't go around that this man stands up for what he believes in 🐐💯,1
"One thing that this is proof of is that mankind was a lot smarter and a lot more advanced than we give ourselves credit for, I’ve believe the pyramids were made by manpower and engineering my entire life. They probably didn’t quarry the stones they probably made them, and it’s very well possible to pull that stone if you but 100’s or even 1000’s if people to pull it. I also believe they used larger animals like elephants to help pull them quicker. Plus mankind was very strong and not fat and lazy like now so yea you get a bunch strong people to pull it they can I’ve seen power lifter body builders pull big rigs by themself, they probably had some kind of technique they made it be able to move and where they made the stones was probably close by",1
"I've already seen the ones in my country, (Mexico-) now I'd love to see the ones in Egypt!",1
How the great pyramids were built?   Yeah I'm still wondering.    This show sure didn't explain how they were built.,0
"I defer to geologist. Geology is a true science. Archeology, not so much. Nobody can explain how they were quarried, transported and built. The fact that Egyptologists (not scientists btw) stick their story of when they were built is outrageous.",0
I remember this. This series was interesting,1
"“World governments lay in ruins, major cities smolder from the attack and those who have managed to survive struggle with a sparse food supply” That’s a description of the present day lol",0
"If they're much more advanced technologically than us, they're most likely highly intelligent. Also, if they have the capability to get from wherever they're from to here, their ships are most likely gonna have shields or armor that can resist our weapons. Travel between the stars requires protection.",1
Aliens are intelligent enough to see that our governments are doing a good enough job at destroying the world,0
I believe that with few exceptions any aliens that are extremely advanced would be kind and beneficial to mankind and might only want to observe and not interfere with our development.  If they are that advanced they don't need anything we have or Earth.  They would have the intelligence to produce it themselves.,1
I’m always wondering how those people immediately think we would need to fight back a species that doesn’t even showed itself yet for better or worse,0
"The most advanced ""aggressive"" alien species is less of a threat to humanity than the earthly powers in control",0
"Of all the multiple universes and the infinity of it all, why would we be a threat to any aliens, or better yet, why would aliens even notice our existence, especially if we are as a planet, near destruction anyway?",0
"This still makes the aliens too primitive and human like. More than likely they'd just turn everything off like a giant emp, and use some sort of frequency that affects our nervous system, knocking us out, then they come down to collect what they want or to take over. Is it exciting, full of action, giving the humans a chance to take a stand? No, but it's more efficient and something an advanced species would do.",0
"It's like Netflix for history... Sign up to History Hit, the world's best history documentary service and get 50% off using the code 'TIMELINE' https://bit.ly/3dPKsuC",1
Amazing production. I hope everyone watches until the end.,1
Enjoyed this video. Makes me wonder how much history was lost by the Damming of the Three Gorges Yangtze River.,1
It's so sad to think of how many fossils were lost:(,0
"What is surprising to see ancient teeth are quite healthy looking, my lifetime addiction to sugar and coffee ruined a few of mine in 69yrs. My children have good theeth cause l showed them my damage and fillings . Enjoyed this presentation.",1
Amazing video.  !ove to see the next one.,1
"This is proof that people are strange and have been strange for a very, very long time.",0
Good one ! Thank you !,1
"Himmlers death isn’t entirely accurate. He was detained for a short time, and although it was reported that he had died from a cyanide capsule, he was thoroughly strip searched for such an item, and during his autopsy, it was noted that he had lots of strange bruises all over his face that were not present when he had arrived. Some suspect that he was beaten to death. Historian and YouTuber “Mark Felton” researched this very subject about Himmler in a YouTube series called “The Death of Himmler” I cannot recommend his videos enough. His videos remind me of what the Military Channel once was before it became the American Hero’s Channel, if anyone remembers that.",0
"It is always amazing how quickly people forget the aftermath of  a specific event. 
Good report. Thank you.",1
I read a book about the Battle of Berlin and it talked about how those foreign SS units fought to the bitter end. Since many had no countries to go back to because they have been captured by the allies.,0
"Goering's original message to Hitler was very concilatory and respectfully asked if a transfer of power was neccessary.  Unfortunately for Goering, the message fell into the hands of Martin Bormann, who despised him.  Bormann changed the tone of the message to make it look like Goering was issuing and ultimatum.",0
What surprises me most with this video is how many people were aware of Hitler's demise and whom tried to destroy his body. I grew up continually surrounded with ppl expressing doubts that Hitler had actually killed himself. It seems pretty clear that he did.,0
"The Wahlter Wenck Story is pretty cool, absolutely insane that he manged at that point in the war to successfully attack and get the people out and save their lives. Sabaton made a song about it, Hearts of Iron.",1
"Did not know about most of his cabinet took their lives. But killing their own children? That upset me, how could any parent ever think of doing that? I realize those types of deaths still happen today, just going to show you barbarism still exists. It's not as if those children could be tried for war crimes. I think we all know those parents have rotted in Hell, praise the Lord!",0

"As a Vietnam veteran with PTSD, I can honestly say, you have your moments - this is a mental illness. But depending on what you experienced in a war, it can bring back certain events. Ten years of therapy in 1999 denied you don't have PTSD, but now, VA says chronic PTSD; I grew it over the last 23 years. I was awarded PTSD this month.

My grandson joined the Army at age 31. He did not need to do that, skilled in plumbing and heating making about $40 per hour with 10-12 years of experience. But my influence as a US Army veteran of 13 years only. 18X training.",0
A lot of what he said in this video is correct. You ASVAB determines what MOS or military  occupational specialty you can go into. I was US Army 1986-1998. I like how there are movie references in the animation.,1
"I have PTSD, and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts... It is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened. You keep thinking about the event, and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened, to get it to stop replaying in your head, this can be at all different levels, from avoiding certain types of people, to avoiding groups, public transportation, or in some cases, avoiding people altogether. Violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations, but most people with PTSD aren't violent, if anything, most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation. I guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs, and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened, and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts.  The idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth, at least, I've never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that, you don't have real flashbacks like hallucinations, you just can not stop thinking about what happened, why it happened, how you could have stopped it, and etc, like anyone in a traumatic event, issue is usually, it goes away after a bit, where in PTSD, you still keep dwelling on it years later.",0
"I can confirm that drill sergeants constantly curse at trainees. The whole ""drill sergeants can't swear at people anymore "" myth is bogus",0
"As far as ""shoot to kill"" goes, we're trained to aim for center mass of the body. This lessens the change of missing. 

However it's actually better to severely wound an enemy soldier than outright killing him. The reason being that now others (who could be fighting or otherwise engaged in some valuable task) have to care for and transport the injured soldier thereby using up resources and personnel. 
As cold as it sounds a dead soldier becomes a supply problem.",0
"As a Marine with 7 years of service, I can say that hazing 100% exists and is an integral part of Marine Corps basic training. Full Metal Jacket was the most accurate representation, but it’s more than that. Also, you don’t shoot unless it’s to kill. Not to disarm, not to scare, but to kill. And if you’re with anyone that’s afraid to do so, you can’t trust them to have your back.",0
"my great uncle served 2 tours in Vietnam as a medical huey pilot, he came back with PTSD and his episodes are usually panicking or scans the room, he only got violent once when a burglar triggered him when he pulled a knife on my great aunt, the guy is currently still recovering in the hospital 3 months later",0
"When I was drafted in 1964, my starting pay was $99 per month.  When I  got married later that year, my wife's allotment of $230 per month was more than twice my base pay.  And, when I was injured in a role as support for a certain civilian agency violating the law in southeast Asia, I was called a liar and threatened with a court martial.  I am proud of my service to my country, but being in the service ducks.",0
"Nutty History content, both audio and visual, is so much more interesting than most YouTube content. The time you spend producing your videos is obvious.",1

Thank you for your incredible videos!,1
"I really enjoyed watching this, I can never get enough of Ancient Egypt. The talent , creativity, and the combined effort that it took to build such Marvel's. I would love to visit Egypt one day, and until then this has me wanting more.   The Greatest combining Mathematics, Science, team work , Creativity and vision. Love it.",1
Everything about Egypt fascinates me. I'm so interested in it's history and want to know more and more!,1
"One of the best explanations of the highs and lows of the power of Egypt, the incredible architecture and art, the power plays and the growth of the Egyptian Empire. Very well done and very well presented. History comes alive with enthusiastic experts talking us through the centuries. VERY talented and professional presenter, famous historians and keeps you interested and even excited. It was long but, I learned a lot. 
      I wanted to be an Egyptologist as a child if I had seen THIS then I would have become one. Fascinating.",1
"This, like so many other documentaries, just barely scratch the surface of the secrets these ancient times and civilizations keep. I believe we will never truly fathom the depth of their engineering feats.",0
I never tire of learning Egyptology. Well produced and sophisticated TV.,1
I love engineering an empire it shows a complete timeline of rulers from emperors to kings to pharaohs.,1

I grew up in the shadow of Cahokia and it has been extremely influential in my appreciation and reverence for all peoples. In college we excavated a game processing camp many miles from Cahokia and the enormity of the resources needed to feed their rapidly expanding population was an incredible story all on its own. I appreciate how thoughtful and well made this documentary is and hope more will be coming in the near future.,1
"There are a lot of unique aspects to this video that I really enjoyed, the small sample of languages, even the hunting reenactments.  Native American cultures are so interesting and diverse, they’re just endlessly fascinating.  I hope the native languages will always be preserved, there’s always resistance by children, especially teenagers, to adopt the more conservative aspects of their parents’ culture.  I remember listening to a Navajo radio station near Window Rock, AZ, and when the “required” traditional song was finished, the young DJ said “that’s enough of that (bleep), the tribe makes us play these!”, then put the latest rock back on.  This is universal, not specific to any cultures, kids around the world always want what’s new!   When they eventually have children of their own, they’re glad they received the traditional culture and want to pass it on.",1
"What an amazing story is being uncovered and told!  So many generations, so many lives, so many experiences!  We owe a great deal to those that came before us and should pass on the best of what we have learned to those who will follow!  We are all different and unique, yet we share what is most important: humanity.",1
"What I always found interesting growing up in S Louis is that the Mississippi Indian Empire had its capital in what is Cahokia, IL but that they buried their dead on the other side of the River in S. Louis.  So Downtown S Louis is built on top of a massive ancient Native American Cemetery.",1
I wish you guys included the myths and stories of the Indigenous people's of the Western Hemisphere.    They're very interesting  and similarly eerie to some of the stories of Europe,1
I very much enjoyed this documentary and learned much from your most excellent examples and explanations.  I grew us with the Sioux in the Dakotas and was always intrigued by these peoples.  Thank you very much for your well-written documentary.,1
"I really liked your documentary.  Very informative.  Would like to see more documentaries on the original people groups specifically of Central America (including Panama).

The original people groups of Panama are Kuna, Ngabe, Bugle, Naso or Teribe, Doraces, Bokotas, Wounan and Embera.  My maternal great grandmother and grandmother were descendents of the Doraces people.  Pure Doraces people exist no more.

I read in a book titled Hurakan, that the first Spanish that came to the Panamanian Isthmus were surprised and terrified of finding mountains of skeletons of persons piled up.",1

"Honestly Captain Kidd just seems like a guy who desperately wanted to climb the social ladder, but his failure as a privateer and the pressure from his crew made him an unwilling pirate",0
"I have always enjoyed reading about pirates, this was very well done !",1
"Kidd, Avery, Teach, Jack, Bonnie, Reid, Roberts. The Greatest of Pirates. They may have done some awful things, but something about their rebellion is inspiring, and for better or worse their legacy is immortal.",1
"If you like this type of stuff. The show from a few years ago called Black Sails is THE best pirate show ever. And one of the best shows in general. It has everything I would ever ask for in a pirate show. It's a legit 9/10 show. If you're into the age of sails, piracy and British naval expansionism type stuff with the Americas/Caribbean of this time period it's a must watch. 
I already watched the series a second time since it ended. It's only 4 seasons but it was ended perfectly.",1
"How disappointing, Captain Kidd being one of only 4 pirates I could name, had a very short and minor career compared to other pirates",0
"this has quickly become one of my favorite history channels, thank you for the wide variety of high quality docs you're providing for free. i have a curiositystream subscription and your channel has a better variety & quality than most of the docs in their history subsection. maybe i'll have to check out history hit instead when i can afford it.",1
"I love stuff involving ships and the ocean. Love learning about shipwrecks, exploration voyages, etc.
Like a lot of events that happened in history, pirates have been romanticized over time and as a result, what we've perceived as how these people lived is not all true.",1
I absolutely love history. I enjoyed this so much and have subbed.,1

"To everyone involved with History Hit’s (including Timeline), THANK YOU!🥰🌻 
I can not tell you how wonderful it is to have all these incredible videos. I chose to care for my loved ones over finishing my greater education and find myself living a meager lifestyle. I wouldn’t change a thing, it was the right choice. That is why I am so grateful for the content you create. In the vast sea of useless shows that disintegrate sense, you are my life raft. 💗",1
Nothing beats the 4 part mini series by PBS on Napoleon!,1
"People either love him or hate him. 

I see a man who was a great opportunist and understood how the world works. Tell me how he is worst than the institutions run today by men but hide from their bunkers? 

He fought with his men, gave epic speeches and rewarded his staff and troops greatly. He gave men a reason to live, even if self motivated. When I listen to people (British) who hate him, they sound envious. Yes, he plunder the Church but didn’t kill any clergyman— which is uncommon in war. 

Historians hide behind the “but the crown was corrupt so the revolution followed.” No bro. Power, wealth will always be corrupt. These people wanted violence for free healthcare, take a hike. Napoleon was no saint. But I rather my country be an empire lead by a patriot than some international court!",0
"More history on History please. The last few months of this channel uploading quality content shows in the enthusiasm and likes the videos get. Please start producing more good content like this and less reality tv, there is a market for actual history shows if they well made.",1
I own this entire series.  One of the best History Channel produced in my opinion.  Peter Weller did an awesome job with it.,1
"I lived in a motel for a while as a kid and it was episodes like these that captured my imagination and led to a life of loving history and studying it in university, history channel please bring this back",1
"Respect to History channel for putting these out for free, while others hoard their old content and charge for it. Y’all some all right people.",1
Ah the golden age of History Channel when they actually aired history stuff....not some crappy reality show.,1
I remember when the History Channel had shows about History.  I miss that.,0
"This programme inspired me to go to Greece for the first time... I saw Athens, Nauplion, Epidaurus, Mycenae and Delphoi. It was wonderful. Greece, like the other countries that I visited during my Eurotrip, made me appreciate the greatness of Western Civilisation and encouraged me to defend it.",1
"One of my all time favorites shows along with Modern Marvels from a long gone era in the history of History Channel. Shame it went downhill with all their “reality” programming, Alien conspiracies,  Pawn and swamp idiots.",0
Phew. Glad to have this one finally finished. I'm finally off to Ireland next week for a much anticipated journey into the islands incredible history as well as insights into my own family history. Of course many videos will follow!  Video wise there are so many ridiculously epic projects in the works. This one on Akkad is a mere taste of what is to come in terms of the Bronze Age world! Don't forget to subscribe if you enjoy the content and leave a comment telling me what you'd like to see covered next. It all helps the algorithm gods to help the channel. Thanks all! See you on the next one. Right.. Back to work..,1
Putting up the name cards whenever you mention or remention people (or say ‘he’) is an underrated genius move. It’s so easy to keep track thanks to it. Wish other documentaries would do that!,1
"The fact that you have single-handedly researched recorded edited and produced this documentary is astounding! I happen to know the amount of work that's involved in something like that, usually it's a team of a handful or even tens of people.",1
"Another outstanding production! This is the sort of thing that should be promoted on YouTube, not the rubbish that always seems to get all the views. What you accomplish virtually singlehandedly is astounding, putting to shame projects with large crews and budgets. Take a long vacation, you've more than earned one for the massive effort this took.",1
"I really appreciate these documentaries. I never had the money for college, so I feel like I’m actually still learning something when I watch them.",1
"The Sumerians were beautiful artisans! I’ve seen Queen Puabi’s artifacts at an exhibit in the Penn Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and they really stuck with me. Before you said Puabi’s name, I already felt the footage you were showing looked familiar. That doesn’t happen to me too often with historical societies (and I go to a lot of anthropological museums), really a testament to how strong of an impression seeing their crafts will leave on you! 

I really recommend anyone who is able to, go visit the Penn Museum. The exhibit on Queen Puabi and her people is pretty extensive! The jewelry especially is so ornate and finely smithed, it’s amazing to think how long ago people were already incredibly skilled in making beautiful things.",1
Hey Pete we really appreciate the amazing writing and hard work you put into these epic videos.  Thank you for all of the great stuff to watch!,1
"An excellent and well narrated documentary. Not detailed enough to confuse the average person, yet broader in interpretation than far too many other works.

A very good balance. 👍",1
"This was amazing , sumer has always been a topic of study for me and has held my interest for years. Because of the people of sumer and the Akkadians , I have a deeper understanding of  biblical text . From the legend of Gilgamesh to Ishtar a people rich in an ancient history predating eqypt. Brilliant work on this my friend , thx again .",1

"This is one of the most interesting documentaries I have ever viewed; also one the most frightening.  I like the explanations of the past extinctions & when, not all the facts are not in, it is really made clear with some educated guesses.",1
….why wasn’t the great oxidation event included on this list? The worst extinction event that killed off close to all prior anaerobic microscopic forms of life.,0
"At the beginning they mention the oceans stagnating but I find that troubling with the effects of the Moon & plate tectonics. Wouldn’t they have had a more significant impact on the Earth? I get confused when our land mass was a combined continent but there’s no mention of that as a factor in these earlier extinctions (or are we meant to know that ourselves?) Also, there would’ve been more frequent meteor impacts at that time too, although they’d be harder to prove.
But I wouldn’t know, I’m certainly no expert on the subject, I just rely on logic.",0
Very interesting! Well done!,1
"Yeah, we are most definitely going to inevitably be our own downfall.

Most Greeks today have or might have had a relative or family friend(s) that will have horror stories to tell because of this war.",0

"536 AD is the estimated timeframe that the Krakatoa volcano experienced an extremely massive eruption that caused a column of smoke, ash, and debris 13 miles high.  So much material was ejected into the atmosphere that it shrouded the Earth causing temperature drops and ensuing human suffering. Krakatoa would erupt massively again around 1200 and the most recent climate-changing eruption was in the 1880s. The 1880s eruption was estimated to be equivalent to 160 megatons, the Tsar Bomba was a measly 57 megatons in comparison.",0

Thanks so much for letting us into your world sir.",1
"This is by far and away the best history channel on YouTube. It's so nice and refreshing to have a pleasant narrator and peaceful, single shot backgrounds. Too much mass produced history docs rely on smash cuts, poor reenactments, cut with boring, 1 line interview answers. 

I know a lot of work goes into these videos. I appreciate your diligence and the quality with which you produce these. Thanks and keep them coming!",1

"Very good story on how lead emissions from automobiles have effected humanity. But even heavier amounts of lead possibly 10,000 times higher were in the average household during that same time period. Most paints contained extremely high levels of lead, many millions of infants would have set their teeth grinding away at the paintwork on the side of their crib. Not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint. Plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes. Most pencils had a high lead concentration, hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil. House roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water. I could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile. Solder usually 60/40 lead - tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment. So you can see the averages home of that same era had copious amounts of lead levels. To blame the the automobile totally for the spike in lead poisoning would be a seriously biased view.",0

"I love your videos! I think you would be intrigued  to hear or perhaps you are already aware  that there is an ancient  record that was unearthed in the 1820's in Palmyra,  New York that was inscribed  in reformed Egyptian by ancient  Israelites. They crossed over the seas from Jerusalem around 600 BC and landed on what they described to be  a narrow neck of land (most likely in Panama). They left their records behind for us and their records spoke of Jesus Christ visiting them after his resurrection.  They multiplied their seed and spread North and South and fought many battles over the  North and South American continents which were considered their new ""Promised land"".  Thus the signs of Christ written with Hebrew origin that you examined would be accurate. There is another record which has been discovered in Panama much like the one discovered in Palmyra, New York. It is a gold set of plates with ancient Egyptian and Hebrew origins as well. Perhaps you could examin the Panama gold plates to see if they are authentic?",1

"I'm beginning to understand chess is really like an ocean in complexity. There's place of brashness, boldness, creativity, fear, light touch, nimbleness, anger, bluffs. It is a beautiful game, rich with stunningly creative ideas and tactics. It has stood the test of time because each generation realizes in greater depth than the previous one, how many more things are possible in a game, how far ahead can pieces support each other, how deep and far-seeing ideas can be, and how rich a battlefield it is to display the full range of human cleverness and emotions.",1
"holy guacamole that was amazing. easily one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. PLEASE do more about chrss history.

The Germans really did hand the Soviets a beachhead fortress in this city. With all the bombed rubble it only became more of a nightmare to advance into.,0
"A couple of my distant German family members were at Stalingrad, and are still there as far as I know. None of the family know when or where they died exactly, but there are Oak trees planted on the family land as a memorial. I only learnt this while looking through family history, trying to learn more about my roots. They were barely in their 20's, conscripted and sent to fight. I'm now older than they were, and I couldn't imagine going through that sort of living hell. I understand they were on the 'wrong' side, and I absolutely respect the Russians for defending their homeland, but whenever I hear the word Stalingrad, it makes me think of those guys. War is a waste, so much potential in humanity just thrown away at the whims of the people in power.",0
"Thank you for mentioning the real reason behind the 227 order. So many people think it was just a cruel note, allowing kgb monsters to shoot soldier at whim.

It is just laughable to allow a tv show to sell all your secrets so whatever they share you cannot really tell whether it is the whole truth or just an explanation to keep you away from too much of thinking.

For once I actually feel lucky to be alive.,1
"Though reminding ourselves of the horrific times in the past might console us to get through this pandemic, you can't deny that the definition of 'catastrophic' is different for everyone. The inequalities are huge. The rosy picture you showed is probably in developed nations. People have lost jobs, lives, dignity, even democracies. Each time period has its own set of limitations and challenges, ours is different.",0
The fact that we enjoy watching these historical videos and also understand them better than at school is amazing,1
"Everyone's understandind of the situation is relative to their own subjective experience. It is unfair to make comparisons bewtween the past and the present without taking into account all the different variables (which is practically impossible).

It's like electricity going out and you saying ""You think that's bad!?! Ackchually humans lived without electricity for thousands of yeears!"". Of course that's a ridiculous statement because humans in the past were not nearly as dependent on electricity as we are now, and even though it may not have been important to them, to us no electricity for just a month could mean the dissolution of the world as we know it.

So please don't make ignorant comparisons between the present and the past as if things were indeed that simple.",0

So I pressed the radio button but it didn't seem to work because it was still Beethoven's 9th. After several minutes of punching that button, I discovered that it had worked perfectly! The radio and the cd were both playing Beethovens' 9th! But the part that stunned me most was that they were at the very same place in the piece! I could shift back and forth and not miss a thing!

One weekend we both were going to our grandparents houses, and we found out that way that we were only a half a street away from each other.

He had also seen my mother's house being built. Kind of crazy!",1

All the things being told in this video are so true because most of them are real experiences of my parents and grandparents and great grandparents. Such a valuable video and great work !,1
"My grandmother was a teenager living on a farm with her mother and father during these times in Dongguan (which has been the electronics manufacturer of the world for the past 10 years) in the Guangdong Province. Her father died rather abruptly from inhaling toxic gases while clearing a crude drainage system on the farm and left my grandmother and her mother behind. She says that before her farm was confiscated by the CCP (her mother was actually compensated the equivalent of pennies on the dollar of what the farmland was worth, but they really didn't have a choice in the matter) there would always be 'distant relatives' and strangers that would stay on their farm and freeload because they had nowhere else to go, had no money and were starving. My grandmothers mother was kind hearted and took in these less fortunate people as best as her means could provide. At some point she housed and fed more than 15~20 of them. For many of them it was a sojourn whilst making their way down to Hong Kong which was free from the troubles of China at the time. Many had heard of the prosperity that the British Colony had brought and wanted a piece of the pie. 
Some years later even my wifes father had swam across the seas to illegally enter Hong Kong when the Government at the time announced they were issuing ID Cards for citizenship. Albeit, his heart still belongs to China as the indoctrination that generation was subject to, to them was really profound. He would often complain to his children ""why do all of you not love China?!"" and they would retort ""if you love China so much what are you doing in Hong Kong?"" to which he would become frustrated for having no good answer.
I asked my Grandmother once ""do you think Mao Zedong is good?"" and she enthusiastically answers without a second of hesitation ""Yes! Yes, he's wonderful!"" and started blurting out the first few phrases of the Chinese national anthem in song. I guess it's why that generation is called the ""Lost Generation.""",0

You put our national hero Vlad Tepes on your stupid list of evil kings ? Vlad was a hero who fought for his people and country against the ottoman empire ! He was betrayed by the nobles and spend 12 years in prison in modern day Hungary! Yes his methods were cruel but he never punished innocent people !,0
"Your take on the Habsburgs is wildly inaccurate.  They didn't rule over the Holy Roman Empire, they reigned, due to the hundreds of independent principalities, marquisates, archbishoprics, free cities and electors. Not even the Emperor Charles V could break this political logjam.  The later empire was enlightened by current European standards, and I'm not saying this because I'm a fan of theirs. I'm not - but let's be accurate, shall we?",0

"The Maritime Disaster that was the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 lives on in memory still in the 21st Century. How remarkable is that really? One of the startling facts for me is that it sank in just under three hours with a loss of 1500 people. It must have been terrifying especially as it happened in the dark. One of the most eerie things I've ever watched is when scientists finally found the wreck, a great distance from where they thought it would be, they were in a mini sub and the bulk of the ship just loomed out of the darkness, it was truly weird.  I don't like deep water in fact terra firma for me thank you. Great video Neil, see you tomorrow.",0

"My 10th grade US history teacher announced to us that we would be taking a pop quiz that was worth 50% of our grade, and told us we had to get every answer right, otherwise, we failed. She handed us the ""literacy tests"" and said we had 10 minutes to complete it. Beside our understandable confusion as to what this had to do with history, we all failed, terribly. That's when she came out and told us that had we been black over 100 years ago, none of us would have been able to vote in the south, and told us these were the literacy tests the curriculum told her to teach us about. She is still my favorite teacher to this day, because she had such an amazing way of personalizing historic events to us.",0

As a white young adult myself, my great grandfather experienced the hardships of sharecropping, and I regret every day that he is not with us for me to learn and record his experiences. On an even worse level, the ignorance of my grandfather's generation on the peonage system and their tendency to spout black criminality rhetoric saddens me. It amazes me how racism can fester so immensely with even the most impoverished folk... My thoughts and prayers go out that future generations take the important duty of learning this history in a more complete manner than mine.

Your line delivery in this video is outstanding. Your passion and sincerity in your presentation of these sad facts shows just how good of a man you are. Bravo! And may every man and woman of every nation know these and all other historical horrors for the betterment of tomorrow and beyond...",0

"My literature teacher told us to come here. I now understand why and that literature goes beyond being entertained by a book or for the sake of pleasure.

"The ONE thing I am really grateful for in the videos by SoL is the fact that they repeatedly assert how everyone is weird. And that we all pretend to be normal and acceptable. Believe it or not, I have spent a lot of my time wondering, worrying and feeling bad because I wasnt perfect - I would talk to myself, get completely lost in day dreams and feel empty inside. Now, I have slowly got myself to think that it is all okay, that everyone is weird and I should just embrace myself - an eternal dynamic mess.",1

In answer to a few of the comments below the video was specifically speaking about what literature is for therefore that is the only subject/medium it should analyse but I agree that any ""great"" art can teach us what it means to be human. ",1

"Our pain moves in an area of ​​vast sadness

We don't find paws that wipe the weights of steadfast fear off our shoulders

All suspicions wake up to the sound of doubt coming from the mouths of the traitors

Nothing compares to the sails departing from the ports of memories

Have you seen with the eyes of your dreams the mirage of years in the seasons of false wish?

Return to your deserted consciences, you poets who escaped from the prison of iron despair.

There are flowers waiting for your words for a winter touch in the summer of burning words.

"I strongly recommend her diaries. It is the best possible novel, her life, written in the most beautiful but unguarded prose. I go back to them every few years when I am on holiday and just want to soak up her lucid thinking and mastery of the English language.",1
"Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own inspired me to read and write. There was something about her piercing words that changed my perspective about many things. I’m grateful for her talent, sad about how much she suffered in life.",1
she sounds like a genius,1
"""Nevertheless, life is pleasant, life is tolerable. Tuesday follows Monday; then comes Wednesday. The mind grows rings; the identity becomes robust; pain is absorbed in growth. Opening and shutting, shutting and opening, with increasing hum and sturdiness, the haste and fever of youth are drawn into service until the whole being seems to expand in and out like the mainspring of a clock. How fast the stream flows from January to December! We are swept on by the torrent of things grown so familiar that they cast no shadow. We float, we float …""

Isn't there a certain irony to Virginia Woolf?  She detested the snobbery of the time she lived in and yet her books have created a new kind of snobbery in literature and academia.,0
One of my favorite female writers. What a woman! My will to study every day more and more is definitely fruit of  her legacy.,1
"It's really amazing!! ❤️ Want on topic like How to read critically, close reading or how to read the text effectively",1
"The first minute of the video is almost the same explanation that was given to us by our professor in literature when I was in college. The rest of it is an expansion of what I already know and at some point, I came to realize that there are more things that I haven't stumbled upon before in the introduction of lit. 

Thanks a lot and I hope you produce more content for both language and literature subjects",1
Great!!! You've regarded the subject from multiple different angles which help us get acquainted with the ins and outs of the topic. But there are intrinsic and extrinsic factors to be taken for granted to decide which texts are literature.,1
"If you enjoyed the video, please let us know by hitting the like button, asking a question, or sharing your thoughts on these definitions of literature in the comments section.  Thanks for watching, everybody!",1
"Your videos are really what makes things interesting and understandable... Can we expect one on literary periods, pls",1
"I SO appreciated this video because, as a literary multi-genre novelist, I've been feeling like the odd man out. I've been told that my work will be appreciated after I'm dead, but that gives me little comfort. However, it's good to know that there really is no consensus on what constitutes literature, good or otherwise. SUBSCRIBED",1

"I cannot imagine any television networks making these sort of programs these days. It is rather depressing, because 1980's is rather recent for some of us. At that time we were worried about dumbing down of culture & yet there were still plenty of high brow culture covered by main stream media. In retrospect 1980s may have been the last era in which high culture would have any part to play in television.",0
Great conversation. Thank you.,1
A lovely conversation ❤,1
"Does anyone have a love-hate relationship with analyzing literature? Like, when the teacher explains the deep meaning of something, it makes total sense and logic to get to that point of analytical conclusion. But, when I try to find a meaning of something, it always turns out to be wrong even though there’s technically no correct way to analyze a text perfectly. It just doesn’t make sense to me when I would get a 75 on a analysis paper just because the teacher didn’t see/analyze what I wrote about a certain text.",0
"This is why I pretty much lost a significant focus on writing and critical analysis. Much of the following is due to bad memory, but, everything I would say and write as my own point of view on the understanding of a character's situation, I would ""get it wrong"". Maybe I needed to grow up from such a sheltered environment and know first hand what the characters in the novels, essays, were going through. I was only a kid.",0
"Thank you SOSOSOSOSO much for this video! My school is crap and doesn't teach us these things, but I want to be able to analyze books and I've sort of been trying to, but videos like these are always a good reminder! Thank you!",1
"I disagree, I have never been able to find the deeper meaning in literature. However, I have always enjoyed when people discuss the symbolism and meaning behind parts of books that I took at face value. Videos like this give me another way to think about what I am reading, and they help me find the deeper meanings of a text when I read it. ",1
Stuff is always so open to interpretation I ragequit before a few chapters trying to analyze literature. It takes all the joy of reading out of me.,0
Some great ideas! This is why I love reading and literature. The human condition is so complex. ,1
You make it sound so simple... definitely using these ideas in my classroom!,1
"Lovely visuals and amazing lesson! Great way to understand storytelling.
",1
"Acknowledging the insight and complexity of finding small and complex clues in a literary work seems to be a way to use in any work.  This is because not only foreign literary works in this way, but also Korean works are need to show complexity and insight to understand. From now on, when I see these works, I will read them with a sense of complexity and insight.",1
This was a great introduction to Kafka . Thank you.,1

I knew Dorian Gray would be on this list! This is the book that made me realize classics could be engrossing and accessible to people today,1
"So many good recommendations! If I could add a few, I'd put:
•Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë
• Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier
• The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett (another children's classic, yay!)
• Steppenwolf by Herman Hesse (the structure can be a bit weird at first, but when the story fully kicks in you're in for a ride lmao)
• The Martian Chronicles or Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury (for those who enjoy sci-fi)
• Pedro Páramo by Juan Rulfo (a piece of classical Mexican literature, said to be the inspiration for One Hundred Years of Solitude)",1
Perfume: Story of A Murderer is one of the books that got me excited about reading in general. Which is both a blessing and a curse because I have yet to read a book as good as it since.,1
You should definitely make videos on how you annotate your books and write your essays 💜🥺,1
The writing in The Picture of Dorian Gray is so unique. I remember reading the first couple of chapters and literally smelling roses and and linen. It felt beautiful without luscious prose somehow.,1
"i'm actually in an English major and English is not my first language (it's Spanish) and yes reading classics is really overwhelming especially if it's not your first language, at least for me what it helped me was start with short stories or poems so you can go slow with unknown words. Also start with classical short stories like a 20th century author for me are a way easier than ancient authors. Another thing you can do is let the text flows naturally, when i read the scarlet letter it was hard for some words but as long as you know the context or what is happening is fine.💗",1
"Every time I watch your videos about philosophy, literature, psychology and sociology I am left with one very unsatisfying thought: there are so many books in the world that I want to read and don't feel like I will ever have the time to though I'm only in my early 20's.",0
School of life has made my insight in philosophy  so much wider.,1
"Anna Karenina and The Death of Ivan Ilyich are among the best books I've ever read. If you do read Tolstoy, make sure to go with the Pevear and Volokhonsky translations; they allow you to get the most from his works.",1
"His life is so wholesome and laddish at the same time, from being a drunk gambling layabout pestering gypsy women then getting bored and becoming an officer to penning literary masterpieces about inner kindness and understanding then just walking out on your family and dying of pneumonia. Absolute madman",0
"My all time favorite writer. An entire School of Life episode could be dedicated to Tolstoy's short stories. Strider - God Sees the Truth, but Waits - What Men Live By - Master And Man - The Wood Felling - Sevastopol... I've read all those stories 50 times, and hope to read them 50 more. James Joyce once said that Tolstoy's How Much Land Does A Man Need is the greatest short story ever written.",1

"not gonna lie, your tiktoks and videos reignited my love for literature so much more than I already did, the way you talk about it really comes through. It made me remember why I love literature so much in the first place!",1
you literally exude elegance. i adore you and your energy,1
"i love literature. I've loved it for as long as i can remember. however, i grew up dirt poor and seeing the way  my parents, who both worked day and night, struggled to provide for us and meet ends meet gives me a pretty innate fear of falling into poverty as an adult. i want to provide for my parents and i want to be able to provide abundously for a kid if i had one. i am lucky enough to have received grants for college, and as much as ait hurts, i don't intend to waste it on a major like English. that's kinda just how it is. wish the world was different. not everybody has that luxury.",1
"this video arrived at the most opportune moment!!  i started off college (i'm currently a sophomore) with studying biochem and holy hell was it torture. before starting college, i thought i really liked science and it is what my parents dreamed for me to study, even most of my cousins have studied something stem (science, tech, engineering, and math) related. while i did ok in my first semesters, i felt REALLY depressed and suffocated. my mental health was at its lowest, it was a terrible time for me. i realized i did not like what i was studying at all and the pressure i felt from my family made it much worse. a week ago, i talked with my academic advisor and we discussed about changing majors, from biochem to english. let me tell you, i breathed a sigh of relief and almost broke down in front of her when i was able to switch to an english major.",0
"I majored in Biology with minors in chemistry and philosophy. Always loved reading and sometimes I wish I majored in English. I want to start writing soon but I just need to find the time outside of my scientific career lol. Like you, I’ve always seen myself as a bibliophile but was frequently discouraged from studying the arts. I kept reading and I now have a small personal library. I love the feeling of just thinking and getting lost in a book; dissecting the words and the scenes they provoke in my mind. You brought up some good points and relatable experiences. Thank you",1
"I’ve always had a passion for reading and writing since I was little, my older cousin who helped me fuel it would always tell me that I’d make an amazing author. I don’t know if I have the talent tbh but it’s something I’ve dreamed of doing forver. But I’m torn between what I wanna do right now it kinda sucks. 
And finally 
I love you too Dakota",1
As an artist/writer myself it has always been a hobby of mine and now I want to turn it into a full-time passion/job. But I am currently in college with my psychology degree because being an empath is also comes natural to me and I want to help people. So I have a lot planned for the future and hopefully I’ll have a work published in less than a year and a half,1

i am a third year college student studying creative writing in a country that gives importance to STEM courses and careers. my family is not at all financially stable and yet im studying in one of the most prestigious schools in the country, i have often felt guilty about this choice of mine because i know my parents do not 100% understand my choice yet they have to pay for my tuition, but luckily for me, my parents support me 100%. i feel this stress to quickly find a job after college and our country doesn't have a lot of opportunities for writers too. but i know this is the path i want to take, o want to work with books, so i just try my best to push down the feelings of fear because i know that if i stay in this path and do my absolute best to find the perfect career, i would be happy for myself and my family. to those in a similar position as me, my word of advice is to just follow what you think is right for you, follow what will make you happy because it is you who will be living with that decision <3 i don't regret my choice.",0
"Jane Austen also teaches us not to be to tough on introverts, they turn out to be her most worthy characters.",1
"These videos have opened my eyes to the beauty of philosophy and literature. It's such a comforting feeling to learn that the questions and often sad thoughts in my head have been thought of and so thoroughly worked on by these great men and women in the past. In the past two weeks since I've started to watch these videos, I have seriously reconsidered many topics and views I have on life. It's a shame American core curriculum doesn't require the teaching of philosophy and reasoning. If more people learned and discussed these issues, it could make our societies and lives so much more fulfilling..",1
Kudos to the animators of all the episodes. I don't think they get nearly enough appreciation :),1
"yes, her novels"" make us laugh.""  Don't forget to emphasize how witty and funny Austen is.",1
"What's even more crazy is that Jane Austen wasn't formally recognized as a great writer until the 1920's! During her life, people did not largely read her work, and it wasn't until many decades later when a Harvard Scholar wrote a seminal paper on her work did she finally get attention!",0
"J. Austen ,Pride and Prejudice is the first novel i read when i learned english, i still found it difficult but beautiful as i improved. i was mesmerized at her writing , how well she could work on the carachters. thank you for making a video of her life, she was amazing writer",1
"As a writer, she's my inspiration, and I'm not a professional writer, but I do love writing!!",1
School of Life is one of the most humanistic channel on YouTube.,1
"I could have listened to more than an hour on this subject alone.  Victorian literature is an enormously broad topic, with writers as diverse as Emily Bronte and Joseph Conrad.  I'd love to see you do a more expanded version.",1
"Excellent video. I appreciate all your research.The victorian era is very fascinating to me. I especially like the mystery or adventure books of the era. My favorite are Doyle, Stevenson, Verne, Melville, Wilkie Collins, and Kipling (though not his more imperialist stuff) . Does anyone have any more classic victorian adventure authors or stories I should try out?",1
I know this video is about literature but I cannot stop admiring the artwork! ❤️,1
"Thank you for a great introduction to Victorian literature. I am especially impressed by how you've also highlighted other aspects of Victorian culture, especially its art.",1
Dickens is without a doubt the greatest writer ever.,1
"I was admiring your writing skills the whole time. Everything just flowed so naturally. I would kill to be able to write like that. 
Thank you so much.",1
"Super helpful! I loved the way you presented the information, it kept me interested the whole way through. :)",1
"Really fascinating!
The British empire having a BILLION inhabitants in the 1800s!? That's getting awfully close to modern demographics...
Though, with the important difference being that modern population numbers rose naturally, and are actually maintainable.",1
Thank you for citing your sources! Wonderful work.,1
Thank you for this nicely done video!,1
Teachers should show this to students everywhere. This channel is a treasure.,1
"I don't think that Dickens' shortcomings as a husband and parent were a result of the difficulty of being great at two things at the same time but rather is an example of how difficult it is to overcome the emotional, spiritual, and psychic damages inflicted by an unhappy childhood. While he was able to turn his pain and suffering into art, quite an achievement, he wasn't able to heal emotionally. It's usually easier to deal with such things in abstract, intellectual and artistic ways. He was in many ways driven by his demons, and that can, surprisingly, take you very far in life, but it doesn't make you a better person. In fact, the success may militate against real change.",0
I'm reading a Charles Dickens' book for the first time and watching this video was really impressive. The strategy he adopted seems very powerful. Maybe we need more of this general awareness and less ready solutions at some level.,1
"Dickens's genius was in bringing characters, and physical objects to life. He was not being ""seductive"" he was making us relive his experience and making  people and places come to life. No one will ever forget Miss Havisham's wedding cake, the character of Bill Sykes, or Mr Micawber. Once you encounter the scenes and objects and characters of his novels you never forget them.",1
"It really made me sad that this person was so great and dedicated in his work but at the same time at the expense of terrible relations with his wife and 10 children…it’s just so freaking sad. You can never have it all, can you?",0
This was an amazing video. I really appreciate what you're doing here.,1
It's just too amazing .Many people got inspired by Charles Dickens .He was a great writer .I would love to read his stories of that era .,1
"Great content.... Excellent explanation about literature. I have registered for the Creative Writing course at college and I was looking for articles or visual content to make myself familiarize with the topic and after watching this video, I can tell this video helped me to understand the very important basic foundation of Fiction, Nonfiction, Drama, and Poetry. I Cannot thank you enough for sharing your knowledge with us.",1
"Thank you very much for sharing such a beautiful, fabulous and beneficial knowledge with reference to Literary Genres and Subgenres, hats off to you ☺️",1
"You have an amazing ability to simplify the basics of literature, much appreciation for your great job.",1
tomorrow is my exam of English literature.  This video and your way of teaching help me a lot. Thank you mam for your effort .❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,1
Useful to the best and helped me to correct my mistakes in understanding... A proper differentiation is given between genres and sub genres💐,1
I bet you're a great teacher. I'm a non-native speaker of English though I can understand you 100%. Your way of teaching is admirable. 😊,1
THANK YOU MAM FOR YOUR GREAT VIDEO WHICH IS A BEST ONE THAT HELPS LITERATURE STUDENT EDUCATION LEVEL ..... PLEASE UPLOAD MORE VIDEOS ABOUT MOST IMPORTANT WORKS THAT EVERY ENGLISH LITERATURE STUDENT SHOULD KNOW..... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE...... SUCH A GREAT VIDEO....THANKS A LOT ONCE AGAIN.....😍😍😍😍,1
This is awesome--would you mind sharing the slideshow that the video is based off of?  Youtube doesn't always work in my county.  Thank you!,1
Thank you mam for this outstanding teaching. Hat's off to you.,1
"Thanks a lot  ma'am ,this is a very  informative video & u explained everything so clearly in detail  & with examples,this video  is a really  helpful  one. When will you explain the rest of the sub genres? Pls reply.☺",1
"I'm an Architect, I never wanted to study literature, I love reading books and discussing them in a superficial level (because I don't know enough as a lit academic, of course)  but sure as hell I enjoy listening people being so enthusiastic about it, the love you people show for words just like I do with architecture. We love nature and humanity and just, i'm so glad people love and work with art.",1
"as a non-native english speaker, i would literally DIE to speak like you. so clear!",0
Her smile talking about literature like: this is the most incredible thing I've learned in my whole life,1
"Me, going into chemical engineering but still a literature nerd: watches this entire thing for no reason",0
This is exactly the type of person I like to be friends with.,1
I have a degree in English Language and Literature and I learned so much from watching this video! Goes to show how wonderfully unique each curriculum is xx,1
"As someone who just graduated with an English (and Women and Gender Studies) degree this is just what I needed! You have no idea how much I miss this kind of conversation and love for books. I'm lucky enough that all my friends are equally as nerdy about our love for literature, but there's something about classes and passionate professors that I is hard to replicate. Enjoy it while you can!",1
"a tip from a once homeschooled, college student, who read a lot of classics: read the annotated versions! read the ones with context! talk to people that are nerds about the historical context of the book! it makes it so much more fun to know WHY certain weird things happen in old books :)",1
"as a beginner to classics myself, i would absolutely recommend the picture of dorian gray to just about anyone. it’s short, quotable, but also uses such accessible language.",1
"The metamorphosis by Kafka is super short, easily digestible and laugh out loud funny in an absurdist sense. 10/10 would recommend",1
I feel like pride and prejudice by Jane Austen was the perfect introduction to classics for me because I was so familiar with the plot that the language wasn’t insanely difficult!,1
Really needed this because I have a weird relationship with classics. I haven’t even started Frankenstein for the book club because I’m genuinely scared lol.,0
"the first classic I read was Picture of Dorian Gray a while ago, since then I have fallen in love with so many classics such as 1984, Wuthering Heights, Pride & Prejudice, Great Gatsby etc. Cant wait to read some of these recs
edit: after some recommendations in my reply, I read crime and punishment by Dostoyevsky and LOVED it, it’s soo good, it’s a lot to take in but regardless, amazing book!",1
"I started reading again this year. I was probably only reading 2-3 books a year for several years straight. For a literature course, I had to read  Persuasion by Jane Austen.  I fell in love with it and finished it in a day. It's also very short compared to her other novels. It kick-started my reading again and I've read 20  books so far this year! Not a crazy number compared to other's, however that's a huge leap from only 2 books a year.",1
"Elaina :333
Thanks You Very Much 😘❤",1
"This anime is very good. Good combination of dark, fun and adventure themes that also talks about the existing social and mental issues in society.",1
Thank you for listening and love it♡♡♡,1
"This song is so calming
And so cute
I love the lyrics",1
"Today i prepare a huge journey because of this song, this anime and kino no tabi. I've already visit Lisbonne, Barcelone, Rome, Naples, cinqua terra, Guadeloupe, Martinique, St Lucy, Paris, Genève, Bruxelles, Berlin, Ireland, greece, Marrakech, Opatija and i look forward to continue",1
This music is very beautiful and can make us imagine traveling far in a pandemic like this. thank you for the music,1
I just finished this show and came straight here to listen to this amazing song again because I was so sad that the journey was over for now...,1
Love this opening.I wish it has season 2...,1
I love this song (The Lyrics is amazing) good job :),1
"One of the best anime I've watched. I love the opening. It's giving a quite nostalgic vibes that feels as if you're in journey as in a fairytale. Flying in the air, imagining myself as a witch. Indeed, this song suits this style for this anime. I absolutely love Elaina...😊😊😊",1
This was really good in closing the gap of understanding between common humans and literature phds. Thank you for the sociological experiment!,1
very amusing especially the beginning. you have great sense of humour.,1
"Hi Mattia, thank you so much for making the video. I recently started my PhD seminars, so this video is very relatable. I noticed that you carry a journal or a planner for your readings. Could you please share with us tips on organizing? I tend to get distracted by other books instead of doing research. Again, thanks a lot. 
Jey from Algeria.",1
This was great. So often sitting at my desk (ten metres from my bed) even seems too much effort so I just work sat in bed. Some days (rarely) I get as far as leaving the house...,1
Found this video while watching 'Day in the life' videos of other PHD students. I'm incredibly happy that I did. Thank you for the sheer gold comedy. Subscribed.,1
"you are awesome. i feel like we are friends just by watching your videos.  thank you for existing, you always put me onto the best books!",1
"Well, you have convinced me to pursue a life in academia studying literature!! :D",1
"😆 very funny, good luck with your studies and stay safe in these unprecedented times. 👍🏼",1
"R C Waldun: Has a great understanding of literature and is a reader veteran therefore has good knoledge of vocabulary
Also R. C. Waldun: the thinky thinky",1
"Ever heard the line: ""He knew everything about literature except how to enjoy it""? That kinda applies here. I never analyze a book or film on the first go. It takes away the magic.",0
"I really liked what you said around 3:25 about analysis being in retrospect.
Recently I read The Iliad, a book that I had given up once before, and which I knew near to nothing about. I skipped the introduction, which was rich in detail that would spoil the book and started reading it. I was initially constrained by the idea that it was a ""difficult book"", but over time, with some paced reading, I found myself really curious about what would happen next. I knew of course that I was doing a ""light reading"" of an overly analyzed book and that I would miss a lot of detail. But I still enjoyed it and after finishing it I went back to read the introduction and found it _incredible_, since it made me think critically about things I had read or notice stuff I missed. As a bonus, it also gave me desire to read it again!

...you've earned a new subscriber from Portugal! Looking forward to more videos!",1
"You are so right! The first reading is to get the idea and enjoy the book, but if you stop there you never know what the book is really about. Not unless it's a drugstore romance, of course.
 I fell absolutely in love with Proust's writing. Luckily, I can read French and re-read my favorite passages in their original language. That's when all the light bulbs went on. I didn't realize it had as many plays on words in it. He has so many clues to the theme that you don't see in English. You just have to read things until you get them. And, like you, I would say that three readings is just about right. Thanks for another great video!",1
"I needed to hear this as I'm about to tackle some of Thomas Pynchon's books.  Please, I'd love if you posted videos more regularly, your content is amazing.

Also, could you maybe do a video talking about your experience reading in other languages? Because it can be frustrating to be facing a lot of unknown words and having to stop the rhythm of your reading, I bet you have a lot of things to say about the subject. Thanks!",1
"First of all, I want to say that I am genuinely in love with your essays. Second, I want to say that everything you say resonates in me in one way that I never experimented before: maybe this channel is what I was looking for. And thirdly... thirdly I want to say that I will stop commenting right now and start to watch the video! hahah",1
"These are really nice clips - even though I doubt I'm really your target demographic, having spent the last thirty years working full time in bookstores. I was particularly taken with your take (sorry) on Proust. I had a very similar experience with Thomas Mann's 'The Magic Mountain'. It took me three or four goes to get through it first time round, but every time I started from the beginning again, I was finding new stuff in it I hadn't noticed before - and in the end taught myself enough German to be able to tackle it in the original. Which was hugely worthwhile, and I still go back to it regularly.
Proust is also great, but there are large chunks of it I found really, physically, stifling and claustrophobic. But if you read anything about his life story, that makes perfect sense!",1
This narrator has the most calming and lovely voice,1
"“Those who can make you believe
absurdities, can make you commit
atrocities.” ― Voltaire",0
This series is SPECTACULAR. ... I've never seen any catalouge of the Intellectual History of Mankind that even approaches the depth of meaning and scholarship you're building here. ... I'm blown away and deeply grateful.,1
"Thanks School of Life, now I need to read some Voltaire. He is a very interesting man, but his ideals are even more interesting. So much mentioned in this video can be applied to the present day and even more can be applied to the human mind. Gotta love some history and philosophy every once in a while",1
"Hey I'm really impressed by your french pronounciation, even in other videos your foreign languages sound flawless. Could you make a video about yourself? Like who you are, what do you do and so on",1
"Thank you School of Life for finally doing Voltaire! He was so witty and his views on many topics are admirable. Please do Thomas Paine next? Also other great thinkers you can possibly do next are David Hume, Thomas Jefferson and Gottfried Leibniz. It would also be so cool if you did science as well along with philosophy and literature. Anyway, your channel is great and I think your doing a fantastic job for culture. I'm glad I've been a subscriber for this long and hope you get many more :)
Also I live in England and I might come visit your shop in London.",1
very well mam. I recommend the newbie who are going to start literature studies first see this video which is about all definitions of literature. I hope after seeing this video you will better understand the concept of literature,1
Thank you madam for making this video. i was searching for the definition of literature and finally i found the correct definition.God bless you madam.,1
This video is very helpful and consist a lot of information about literature .. JazakAllah Mam,1
Mashallah good way of define of every definition and all the points 😍👌 well done dear,1
Thanks for this!❤️very well explained❤️,1
"well done ,good collection of definitions and very well explained.",1
"Greatest mam, 
recently I've started doing my English literature so I was very confused as well worried about literature but after watching this video I'm very pleased I'm cleared.",1
Well done for selecting a basic topic and elaborating in precious way👍👍,1
Wow. What an explanation sister. Thankful to you,1
"I’d love to see Andrew do more literature based videos. As a conservative patron of the arts, I feel pretty alone amidst the utter desecration of the greats by the left. Shakespeare has been cancelled in some universities in the UK (where I am from)",0
"Andrew, thanks for another great entry. Please consider turning this into a series. You do an excellent job making these classics feel relevant and essential for understanding and navigating contemporary issues.",1
"His son, Spencer Klavan had a podcast, “Young Heretics”, that examines many of these books. I recommend it, especially if you tend to read books rather straightforwardly.",1
"Husband and I went to the Green Knight movie on a whim, not knowing what it was about.  We both absolutely loved it.  Thank you for reminding me about it, I want to read the story now!",1
"It's a bit of a hard read at first, but ""Le Morte d'Arthur"" is another great piece of late medieval literature dealing with the Arthurian legend.",1
"Excellent list.  I would also suggest that anyone interested in Western thought, art, and culture develop a basic understanding of the traditional Christian Mass since that is foundational.",1
"I read The Great Gatsby for my AP Literature class and it is one of my favorite books ever. It's fantastic and I had no one in my class who agreed with me. But everyone should read it, it's a masterpiece.",1
This guy explained better under 18 mins than my professor in a semester!,1
"This was an unbelievable help. I had to write a 10 page literature review in approximately 24 hours because like any good grad student, I procrastinated. What I saw as a daunting task was quickly made easier after watching this video. I broke down 10 different peer reviewed journal articles into their own segments, then combined them. Added an intro and a conclusion and voila I was over 10 pages. I might make it through grad school after all.",1
"David, I used your guidance in my thesis for my dissertation.  The quote from my committee memebers about my literature was as follows, ""This is the best literature review I have ever read and I have read a lot of them""  David, thank you, just great stuff in your videos.",1
"Thanks David, your help with this literature review during a pandemic, literally meant the difference between me passing or failing. Thank you so much.",1
"It is so amazing how one becomes so motivated to start working on something as soon as they begin to understand it. I have been putting off my lit review for 3 weeks because I did not really understand the 24-page document given to us by our tutor but after watching this video, I'm now so confident and fully understand what exactly it is that I need to do for my assessment. Thank you for such a wonderful and informative video.",1
This should be required watching for everyone writing their first literature review! The example is very helpful and I feel so much more prepared after watching :) Thank you!,1
"Thank you for making Literature Reviews so much less daunting! I have roughly 24 hours to complete a 1,500-word literature review and I have been feeling so down, staring at my blank word document, having no idea where to start. As a first-year, mature aged student who hasn't done any sort of higher education for the past 10 years, I can't tell you how helpful this has been.  I finally feel as though I MIGHT be able to finish it by the deadline! And then start on another 2,300-word Literature Review due roughly a week later 🙃",1
You are the professor a student imagines getting in University. Thankyou for your support,1
"I have been months and months searching on u tube .....no one has explained  professionally like this professor  ,,,,,,that's the high quality  way of teaching 👌thanks alot",1
"I watched this in my bachelor's degree, and liked the video. Now pursuing my Master's degree and come here again to remember all of these tips, helpful again second time, i wish i can give you more than one likes, thank you so much for clear, quick, precise explanation.",1

"I hope that God abundantly blesses you!!! 
I’ve nearly cried all day because everyone’s break down of a literature review is so confusing and non direct about what it actually is you should do! Thank you so so much for this video",1
"Chelsea, I'm a teacher, and I have to confess that I was waiting for you to miss a detail I would have to pause and explain to students. It didn't happen! Your videos are excellent.",1
"Thank you so much for this video. You have explained clearly in 23 minutes what my lecturers have failed 2 years straight, well some anyway but yeah, thank you so much.",1
This was very well done. I feel confident in my ability to complete this now. I have never done a lit review before but now I feel like I have. Thank you!,1
I have never been this energized and excited before writing a lit review...Thank you for such an informative video.,1
The exact thing that we were waiting for! Especially the part with data search. Thanks for your explanation!,1
Chelsea Seburn you've saved my life!  Working on my thesis for my master's in climate justice and this has taken my overwhelm down about 501869701991038568000000 notches.  Thank you so so so much!  Heading to your other videos now to continue getting a handle on my research,1
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, and God bless you!!!  I am writing a literature review of technology in nursing and did not realize how much my annotated bibliography and literature matrix would help in putting it all together.  You gave great examples for structure of the intro, body, and conclusion and useful points of transition.  Also, now I realize that I can write my paper as a thematic literature review.  Absolutely brilliant!!!",1
dude this is driving me crazy instead of travelling the world and having fun i'm here struggling to write a literature review,0
"Great video! In my experience as an academic writing teacher, literature review is one of the things many students struggle with.",1
"Learnt more from this video than I have from my lecturer the last 2 months, thank you 🙌",1
"Thank you for putting this into such a short, succinct video. Currently have nine days to complete my UG Diss and this has really helped! 🙏",1
"I just started my literature review from today and I was in hyper panic mode until I heard from you -it's just simple and not to panic, made me calm down. Thank you.",1
"The literature review has always been a pain in the head. Especially that we are now in a pandemic, students (such as I) have problems in collecting the necessary number of sources. Thanks, Ms! I enjoyed the video. And thank you for being a big help to those who are struggling.",1
So well done! This would've been helpful for me to have found a month ago BUT it is super helpful for my editing :),1
1984 is one of the best books I've ever read.,1
'None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.',0
"I'm a foreign teenager, I enjoy watching your videos a lot, especially the ones about literature. It's so easy to understand every word and the meaning of every sentence, I'm extremely happy that I discovered you. Could you make a video about Edgar Allan Poe? I just started reading his stories and want to know more about him. Of course I'll read the biography in my language but you make some very interesting points, which is the reason I ask you for it. Thank you.",1
I read “1984” and “Animal Farm”. Great books!,1
"""Sophisticated entertainment and empty headed news reports all wrapped up in a constant reference to freedom."" Sounds like America.",0
"I couldn't have more love for this essayist and for this author, who woke me up for good when I was just a kid in Junior High. I share his devotion to language and the free and organic use of it, and of the wisdom of the ordinary people all over the world.",1
"Admittedly silly to subject Milton and Shakespeare to a kind of competition but, this is well worth your time and effort. The  benefit of having talented professional actors reading the small bits of their works takes this endeavor  far beyond the typical classroom experience. Truly enjoyable and enlightening.",1
"The two scholars are amazing!! And the actors are sublime!! I've never felt so happy in my life, yet so jealous of those in that conference room!! I've been clapping and cheering and crying all at once. WOW. Thank you!",1
"Very interesting discussion, and *AMAZING* acting/reading! Thank you for posting this.",1
"""As a dramatist Shakespeare makes humans into important huge things. Milton seems to be making important huge things have a human personification.""

It truly is comparing apples to oranges. Both are preeminent English lit. masters and are distinguished in their own right. Enjoyable and enriching experience!",1
"Thank you, Intelligence Squared, for compiling the most brilliant, instructive debate I have ever had the pleasure to view-- the entire show enhanced by the highly talented actors who played bit parts written by both of the 2 literary giants under discussion. 
Tonight's show will become one of my life's unforgettable experiences.",1
"This was a lovely event, worth it for the acting alone, especially the remarkable rendition of the scene of Eve's awakening.

I do think the debate was played too much on Shakespeare's terms and turf, in part because Prof. Smith politely allowed it to stay there. Some thoughts:
- Biographical silence favours Shakespeare (about whom we know relatively little) than Milton, whose remarkable life positions him uniquely to speak on matters of loss, weakness, aspiration, perseverance, hatred, and love. This was hardly raised.
- So too historical context: Shakespeare comes clearly out of an Elizabethan tradition laid out in part for him by writers like Marlowe and co-developed by writers like Jonson; Milton obliterates the norms of mid-17th century poetry with a literary iconoclasm surpassed only by his republicanism.
- Drama favours interiority, and interiority here was presented as the sine qua non of literary greatness. Milton and most literary history would not have thought it so; though the actors brilliantly depicted M's dramatic imagination in Paradise Lost, his goal, unlike Shakespeare's was not primarily to explore the contours of the human mind, but to go beyond them. His theme is not finally the human, but the human-in-the-cosmos.

In short, we judged here whether Milton was better according to the criteria of Shakespeare. Shakespeare will win that battle with anyone. Milton will sooner decline your crown and force you to ask whether you're asking the right questions in the first place.",1
Harriet Walter embodies so perfectly Lady Macbeth that it's shocking at sight. Bravo!,1
"Imagine the RSC, with all its talented actors, producing an audio-book recording/dramatisation of Paradise Lost. Oh, bliss!",1
Lady Macbeth was stunning. Absolutely stunning. Her acting was on another level. That’s passion for the work on an almost transcendental level; she BECAME that character. MAN. Goosebumps.,1
"I'd just like to point out that Odysseus' sleeping around was necessary for his survival. If a powerful goddess like Circe or Calypso wants to have sex with you, you don't have much choice. If you reject them, it could spell doom for you, or your loved ones. Horny gods punishing mortals for denying them sex is a recurring theme throughout Classical Mythology.",0
"The Odyssey is Homer un-writing the Iliad. When Odysseus raids, cheats, and behaves generally like a Iliadic hero he is at his weakest (and at the beginning of his odyssey). By the end he refuses to cheat on his wife with the incredible fantastic Nausica, he shows almost inhuman patience and self-control in the face of the suitors' abuse, and he choses nostos over kleos, the choice Achilles couldn't stand to make. What's more, Achilles himself discredits the entire premise of the Iliad when Odysseus sees him down in the land of the dead, by saying that ""it is better to be the lowest slave than king among all the unnumbered dead.""

And he doesn't ""lie to everyone he knows."" His Cretan narratives are really important, non-violent defenses against a situation similar to Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. ",0
"Please don't ever stop making literature videos, because we don't have English literature in high school in where I live and I want to study it so bad, even if my English is really not good",0
"I always loved the Odyssey; both in High School English and the movie. To me it was one of the ultimate journey epics. Like LotR, it's just a very very long journey with a penultimate goal of returning home, but with fun little adventures and trials along the way.",1
"So even Odysseus, who is wise enough to be praised by Athena for his wisdom, loses himself in war. Does that say something about our attraction to war?",0
">Odysseus is literally made Calypso's stud
>Forced to have hot divine sex every day for seven years
>Calypso asking him every day to live as an immortal with her
>Odysseus STILL wants to go back to Ithaca and Penelope
>He goes to the water and cries every day looking out towards Ithaca
Odysseus' devotion to his wife and people is superhuman, that's why he's the hero.

some nice piece of information I found on the web",1
"For an interesting read, some people may want to check out The Penelopiad by Margaret Atwood. It's a novel that was later turned into a play and tells the story of Penelope in Ithaca while Odysseus was gone. It's an interesting contemporary view of a classical text.",1
"I love that quote about literature being forced critical thinking that cannot be Googled. I hope this is where the world is going soon. Into a place of books and curious reading, rather than simply Googling and having things fed to you.",1
"Thank you so much for this - I'm finally following my heart and transferring to a major in English Literature, coming from a biology major. At times I get anxiety about it, wondering how what I am learning will be useful, aside from the fact that I love it. This is just what I needed to hear.",1
She is a lovely lady. Glad I found her.😊 I am also a Literature student and I love it😍,1
"Dear Denielle, Thanks so much for your speed in which you remind me of preparing Cambridge C1- English Exam. I failed it a couple of times. However, I never have lost my perseverance to do the exam over and over again. As a financial analyst, With reference to the return of investment, time spent, this is my worst deal. However, When it comes to understanding humanities, becoming comfortable with ambiguity, and making me a rounded person, the answer to this valuable investment is definitely ""yes"". Well appreciated.",1
I wish you could be my teacher 🥺,1

"This song makes me feel really good, I feel a magical feeling and I feel like I want to go on an adventure...what a great song",1
This song is wonderful and magical. Perfect OP for Majo no Tabitabi.,1
"There's a witch with ashen hair fluttering in the wind, flying in the air on a broom. Who is this beauty, as pretty as flowers who makes even the summer sun want to shine brighter? That's right! It's me!",1
"The first time I've heard of this and I'm already blown away. Since the second episode, I never skipped the OP ever since. Such magnificent piece!",1
"This was wonderfully explained, I thank you sincerely. You just singlehandedly clutched an IB student's EE from spiraling into complete and utter disaster",1
"""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" truly is one of the best books I've read so far in 50 years of reading experience. Reminds me to read it again sometime in the near future...",1
"Pedro Páramo by the Mexican writer Juan Rulfo is one of the masterpieces of Latin American literature, it is considered the novel that inaugurated the literary subgenre of ""Magical Realism in Latin America"".
Juan Rulfo's work finally gave me the path I was looking for to continue with my books,” Colombian Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez confessed in an interview.",1
"I read a magical realism text for the first time in a magazine. It told the story of three dragons who were adopted by a couple. they raised them as if they were human. The way the author narrated the passage of their age, in childhood, adolescence and even adulthood is comical and fantastic at the same time. Dragons fight, mess, do drugs, get married, divorce and die.",1
"You forgot the most important and influential book of Latin American Magical Realism, the corner stone: Pedro Paramo by Mexican Juan Rulfo. Latin American writers influenced Salman Rushdie, et al. BTW, Garcia Marquez is a Nobel Prize laureate.",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed this and I'm glad I already had a solid enough concept of Magical Realism; yet this made me aware that culturally it made such a political impact. My debut book ""Just a Little Broken"" I like to think is in the same vein as the genre. It allows a significant amount of freedom in storytelling, especially within a reality-based land. I appreciate all the information and nuances packed into these videos.",1
"I feel like reading Rushdie's ""Midnight's children"" again now. Thankyou for the profound explanation. Cheers 💛",1
"Excellent explanation. I completely agree with your explanation of magic realism and also the idea that it is a post colonial resistance against Eurocentrism, but I think its scope is even bigger. One aspect of magic realism is politically ideological, that is the postcolonial stuff. Another aspect is challenging the constricted mentality created by strict adherence to materialistic/scientific determinism. This aspect is more philosophical, and not just ethical like the ideological aspect but also epistemological or maybe even metaphysical i.e. it may draw our attention to fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the likes. This is just my personal opinion.",1
Girl you saving me! Making this so simple and understandable,1
Thank you so much for this clear explanation! I read the whole section in my textbook but I was still so lost,1
"Thank you, your videos are informative, to the point, and super useful!",1
"You are a great presenter. I think it is great to have an example to support your video. My students have been encouraging me to include more and more examples, some even say this is the best way they learn, through seeing the good and bad of other students dissertations. My channel was originally set up for my classes, but now I want all to access, we need to me one big supportive community regarding help with academic skills that lead to student success - Dr M D Egan",1
You have no idea how you've helped me throughout my research project with your articles and videos. Thank you.,1
"Thank you for the clear explanation 😊, love it.",1
"I remember doing my literature review this year and go a very good grade, thanks to you're formative information.

Now what's due is my dissertation, for sure I'll be back.",1
Thank you for explaining what is literature review. I understand it very well.😊,1
Me actually pausing the video to go get a cup of warm tea xD,1
"As a student of literature, I fully agree with what you're saying in this video. I almost use the same exact same arguments when someone asks me why I study literature lol 
I love how you and your mum discuss literature so casually and playfully, that's some real family goals right there",1
"Why I read and what book I read depends on my mood or my aims. Sometimes I read for a bit of escapism. Other times it’s to learn. Sometimes it’s both. I love it when a book teaches you something that you never realised or expected, and it stays with you and even changes your way of thinking.",1
"Emma, you have the best non-book channel book channel on YT!",1
"I had forgotten about what it feels like reading a good book, since it's been awhile- I haven't taken a English class this semester. But your thoughts made me remember. All the reasons you talked about reinvigorates my curiosity to think about the human experience, question the beliefs/mindsets I currently have, and, well, to study literature!",1
"When you read a novel, how much do you focus on the text vs the background of the author? For instance, one of my favorite books is The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov. If you read it by itself, it is such an interesting novel, however, learning the history of its writing in the background of Stalin's Russia makes it even more interesting. How much time should we dedicate to looking beyond the four corners, if at all?",1
"I usually pick up a book for two reasons, either because I like to see what it would be like to live in a different reality (and that is why I read a lot of fantasy and horror) or because I want to know how it is like to live and think as a certain person or in a certain place and time (for that is when I go to classics and more international literature). Also I totally agree with the ""people should read classics"" thing, it's so cool when you read a classic and finally get this book that keeps being referenced everywhere and you understand why that book has been read for generations.",1
Thank you for this video. I'm currently curating my documents and this is helping me search based off of the keywords.,1
"this should be titled how to search for a literature review, not how to write one.",0
"You are fantastic. I am following all of your videos and its really simple and clear.if you could offer the coarses on the website 360 for free for developing countries, it would be marvellous.",1
"Dear Greg, Thanks for the video. That was quite helpful!
I have a question: A word when added to an existing search using AND gives me nearly 700 items as results . The same word when added as a mesh gives me ~ 200 items. Why is this different? Thanks once again, G",1
Really great. I am writing review paper on drought tolerance in plants. This video open gateway to search for articles... Thank you very much Sir for video...,1
Thank you for this helpful video. It is well-presented and visually clear.,1
"Nice and clear, I will show this to my students. They have been asking me to do feedback and commentary of examples of literature reviews so I have made some for them and now made them accessible on youtube",1
"This is so helpful!!
Just wanna say that
Thank you for helping me gain knowledge lol",1
"Firstly, screening the literature is THE most important aspect of a systematic review, and for any other types. So,not teaching students how to use Ovid, Medline, Cochrane, tec. and only relying on PubMed is certainly the worst start up. You miss such a large number of studies that whatever conclusion you try to draw will be biased, and therefore unreliable.",0
Thank you for your great course as always！,1
Mackie's enthusiasm for Shakespeare is fantastic. ,1
His delivery at comedy is brilliant.,1
I love how he sticks to it and says it seriously a second time.,1
Kumail is the man! I wish someone would give him a lead role since he's always the support for others. I would watch out the shit out of that show if they ever make it.,1
Kumail is always hilariously funny,1
Is there a part 2 to this. That was a really funny segment.,1

"Here is the Transcript.

The literature review is not an essay, it is not a research paper - the literature review is part of your essay, the literature review is part of your research paper or maybe stand-alone product if you're master's degree or doctoral degree program and you have to do that for. But regardless of whether part of the research essay or stand-alone product, one thing the literature review does not do is - It doesn’t prove, state, illustrate, collaborate or develop your main point, that's in the body of your essay. The literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper. Well, what the heck does it do then?

Well, the literature review is divided into the following key terms: first is, the whole idea of what the heck in the literature? The literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic. Now remember I said narrow topic, we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes, you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic, that's the first thing that you need to know. The literature is published, peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic. Second thing, the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed. What the heck of a review, well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it. What is that snapshot going to capture? That snapshot going to capture major concepts, the major point, the major outcome, the major whatever in that source. It’s not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot. Once you get all those snapshot done, you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of time-line situation, maybe not, but the key years is you’re going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element, may be on a time line type of situation.

Now the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why they're hack are you doing all this stuff. Well, I think there are three reasons, probably, why you're doing all this stuffs in school. In the first one, off course, to improve your own understanding, as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics  into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding, build your background, build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline. Then in of course in this paper, when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject you're going to be demonstrating that knowledge, demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment. But you know, the real purpose of a literature review is, it’s a reader service, it something you doing as a favor for your readers, what are you doing you are bringing them up to date.

What’s the first thing you and that old friend do? You ask each other- hey what you been doing all these years? Fill me in, update me, you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in, you updating them. By bringing them up to date, then you can start at the present again.  You see what I’m saying, you can bring them along that time-line of the path, letting them know the key element, the major concepts, the key element in your life and what you dare? Boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literature's review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas, past scholars, the past researchers boom and then come your idea.",0
Writing my first literature review in a college research paper and this video was a lifesaver. Thank you for clearly explaining the topic and helping me to feel more confident about my paper!,1
"David, you are the BEST on YouTube in explaining concepts relating to education coursework. You explain everything so simple which everyone with diferent learning levels can understand. Keep up the good work!!! You are the BEST!!!",1
My teacher could not explain what a literature review was clearly no matter how many times I asked him. Thank you David!,1
"Greetings Mr. Taylor, I want to thank you for your tutorial on what a literature review is. My first paper as a doctoral student was rejected because I and several of my fellow classmates came into the program writing in the form of a narrative. Your pin-hole concept nailed it on the head. I used it throughout my Ed.S curriculum and can't wait to apply it to my candidacy cognates. Thank you so much.",1
"OMG I wish my professors were as down to earth and clear as you are! You've made this so easy to understand, and I appreciate it! I probably speak for every student that see your videos...thank you.",1
I remember the first time I watched this vid last year when I was in second year 'cause I had to do a lit review (for the first time!). Now I'm coming back just to update myself before I start another lit review - this one for my final year dissertation. Your video still wins hands down. ,1
"You are a great teacher, this video really helped me breakdown the concept and have a better understanding of the topic.",1
What a great and simple explanation.  You have helped a ton!  Thank you!,1
This has taught me more in a few minutes than my university has in 2 and a half years.,1
"Excellent presentation, I wish our university had such useful guidance sessions... many thanks",1
"This is commendable!! I was struggling in finding out what a literature review is all about. After wasting weeks searching, I stumbled upon this minutes before my paper is due. Thank you so much for sharing.",1
Thanks a lot for this wonderful lecture. I really liked it and desperately need it. I am looking forward for more wonderful classes like this.,1
"Informative, specific and practical guidance. Excellent video. Thank you.",1
"this is a really clear, concise and helpful lecture. Thanks!",1
Thank you very much. You have made incredible presentation that put all necessary details in the logical order that is easy to understand and follow. Thanks once again.,1

"As the new Mexican boy at the school in VA,  I didn't speak any English, but there was this beautiful girl in my math class who took her time to teach me by sharing some music, including this song.  After about 2 months of hanging out on a daily basis, we started dating and we were almost inseparable.  One day while she was visiting her grandma in Vermont, some drunk driver crashed into her and she lost her life, along with her dad 😔 .  She was the sweetest person you could ever meet.    I miss her so much 😭 .   I listen to this song imagining her by my side.",1

She’s slowly bringing  back 2009-2014 music I love her so much,1
"Once again, Joel Corry cheered me up when I needed it.  I was driving to the bank to deposit a check from my late father's estate, and I was surprisingly emotional about it.  This song came on the radio and made me smile a little bit.  The power of music.  Thank you Joel and Raye and David.",1
This song is heavily nostalgic. Sounds like from the past. I love it.,1
Muito boa essa música to viciada nesse música 😁😊😍,1
SUPER track! Got party vibes with this one. RAYE's smooth pop/EDM voice with the catchiness and rhythm of Joel's tracks and the influence of David Guetta's sounds.. And a fun video with an underlying message. Perfection!,1

"I’ve had a rare form of chronic bronchitis since I was little. I know my disorder is probably going to cut my life short, but I love every day that I get.

This song is so sweet in a sad way. It makes me think of when I was younger and Mom would bring me a cup of chai tea (she said the caffeine would help my head and my chest). Every bit of the lyrics seems like it’s about something special to my memories.

I was in the hospital a few months ago and I was so scared to go to sleep. I wish nobody had to be this sick when they’re still young, but it’s somehow a little bit comforting to listen to this. It’s all the thoughts I couldn’t put into words.

Thank you for making this song. I’m so glad it exists.",1
The hardest part in your life is when a person who gaves you the best memories becomes a memory.,0
Fun fact: when you are happy you enjoy this song and when you are sad you understand its lirics,1
Man I miss music like this! Only 16 but I still remeber all the good hits wayyyy back...,1
I remember hearing this song and it made me think of someone whose voice reminds me so much of J. Holiday. Besides that the consistent bass drum just makes you feel like your heart is beating along. ,1
I'm like going through all these old songs I used to love when I was a kid. And now I'm like why the hell was my mom sitting there letting me sing every word of these dirty ass songs 😂😂😂,0

"Wayne is the kind of success story that encourages me as a underground artist with a small following. Seeing how he’s developed his skills and slowly blown up after seizing each and every opportunity he’s been giving has been inspirational! Mans has quickly become a mainstay in the industry and for good reason. Dude is too nice! I know if I put in the work, I can reach a larger audience some day too, but for now, I’m happy being a supporter. My turn will come too. Salute to Wayne🔥",1
This came out when I was in high school. So nostalgic. I'll probably be 80 and still jamming!,1

It's amazing how Chris Brown can make a song as dirty as this one and make it seem like something that'd be closer to like a cute/love song.,1
Taken this song into 2021 who else?🥰,1

This song will never get old as long as I'm breathing and coherent,1
This song is so AWESOME and i can't get it out of my head!,1
"I think this probably resonates with all of us who have been single a while after  being in a serious relationship.

You get yourself into situations with people you like, but couldn’t get serious with. Both playing a slight game with each other. You like each other. But don’t need each other. Both wanting to give each other late night calls. Sometimes resisting. 

You feel all strong and happy to be independent all day enjoying life, come home make yourself some food but come 8-9pm you often. realise you actually don’t wanna be alone that night again, and damn, you should have arranged something with someone. But now it’s maybe too late.",1
I love it so much it's really good 🤩,1

"I remember when this song first came out and me listening to it. I truly did listen to this song every day and never really took in the true meaning of these lyrics. Now sitting here 2 years later I look back on this song and finally understand. Although the meaning is in the title, there is so much more beauty and emotion put into this song that I hope you can understand. I just remembered this song a few days ago and im glad I did. Whenever you read this, I hope you are able to enjoy this song as much as I did listening to it the first time. (6/6/22) at 11:42",1
Bon Jovi never gets old...especially songs like this.  They just move your entire soul.,1
"- One of the best songs of 1992;
- One of the best songs of the 90s; 
- One of the best songs of the 20th century;
- One of the best songs of all time.",1
"This was the song my mum always asked me to play in the car on way home from shopping, she passed away on Saturday. I'll never forget this song now",1
I'm leaving this comment here so after a month or a year when someone likes it it'll remind me this song again. 😊,1
"Mr.Jon Bon Jovi is probably the most underrated singer of our time, recently heard him without background music and choirs, he's pretty amazing singer.",1
Listening to this song at night while closing your eyes just bring you to a whole different place.,1
I grew up with this.. still my all time favourite. They don't make them like this anymore. Also great love and respect for Bon Jovi ♥,1
After probably three decades this song came to mind out of the blue - still as good now as it was when it first came out in the 90s.,1
"It's great video 🔥👌 I want 2 part, please 😉",1
I enjoy watching your videos to unwind after a long day!.,1

"I went to Columbia High School with Rotimi & Sza. Homie was a Star B-Ball player at the school. Columbia, if I'm not mistaken, still plays his version of the National Athem, at all sporting events. Super proud of the two! Keep going guys, much respect! 🙏🏽",1
When having a bad moment this song definitely puts me in a vibe of its own 💃💃,1
2021 still one of the most underrated hits 🔥🔥🔥,1
"Mom: ""Wake your ass up for classes"" 
Me:  ""oh nah nah nah nah nah na There's a meeting in my bed """,0
This was ahead of its time. If it came out right now in 2022 it would GO!!!!!🎯💯,1

"I really don’t know if their house value could go up or down, up with the amount of stuff they’ve installed, or down because they’ve took about 25% of the walls out 😂",0
I’m actually pretty glad you added the secret vent door too because gaming consoles usually need  ventilation so that the room itself wouldn’t over heat and that’s often left out in “secret room” builds.,1
I love how these guys are out here making the forts that we all wanted as kids,1
"Awesome project, guys! But why not just put a hinge on the secret door so the bed would still be usable? Or maybe put a hydraulic platform so you can lift the bed and enter the secret room without actually putting a hole in the bed? Just my thoughts.",1
I would gladly pay for these guys to do something like this in my home,1
"Looks like this YouTuber will be the architect of an unusual building, but epic... :)",1

"I read about a man in his 50s that started investing in stocks  then retired in 2years with over $6million, that right there is my utmost goal and I'd really appreciate clues and tips on how to reach this goal within 5years",1
"Thanks for the tip jim, going to finally open a long position on BBBY",1
"Little does he know, the ape will not going to let this happen",0
"It's nice to see these very quick unscripted ""breaking news"" type of videos",1
If people want to worship one mans words and previous actions to the point where they buy a stock on command at an elevated price.  Then its their own damn fault,0
"If you don’t do something about your financial situation, your income remains unchanged while expenditures keep rising. These got me seeking the best answers to invest my 50k $. Any ideas here?",0
"I think more than anything the meme stock phenomenon is a protest against the vitriol exhibited towards the retail investor. With that said, I do and like having a small portion of my portfolio reserved for speculation, having made some good money off of picks like AMC and BBBY. It’s small enough where it doesn’t hurt my long term investment goals and strategy, and large enough to “have fun” with. As long as you don’t put more down than you’re willing to lose and fully acknowledge it’s a casino, have fun with it. Just be safe, set your stop limits, and take profit as you go. (Not financial advice, just how I conduct myself)",1
"Ah, BBBY, yes, thank you. I threw in a little bit of money and ended up tripling it. Thank you. 
I am too wimpy to go ""big"", but I am happy with the small win. Never throw a large sum into something this volatile.",1
"2 videos 2 consecutive days, impressive!!",1
her editing makes me feel like she’s the only one left on earth,1
"her content is maturing the same way she is. less chaotic, more genuine and realistic. loving it.",1

"""Tomorrow is about to be crazy. I'm going to fucking do some crazy shit, like I might even go to the grocery store tomorrow"" LMAO ME TOO EMMA",0
emma posting twice a week is literally the best thing that could ever happen,1
The fact that her life is so relatable to ours makes me want to be influenced by her lmao,1
I like how Emma doesn’t need someone around her. She’s able to enjoy her day without anyone.,1
"i was so brainwashed by the whole ""life of an influencer"" from social media, that i never realized that they're just like normal people. seeing her journal, lay in bed with her cats, without the chaos of having a million things to say, all for the sake to keep us entertained. that really made me cry a bit. i love how raw her content is now. i feel so at peace. thanks emma",1
"This new editing style makes me feel so emotional. Not in a bad way. Just every single time I watch them, I feel so many good emotions. Love this new style Emma, and from the looks of the comments, everyone else is enjoying it too. You are truly an artist.",1
Give a big welcome to Saint Punk with his smashing Monstercat debut!,1
Appreciate the love everyone and thank you Monstercat! 🤘🏼,1
People coming here from streams just shows how much promotion the streamers can give a song. Sucks they can barely play any music without getting striked :/,0
even sykkuno is jamming to this song during getaways NODDERS,1

I just love it how Andrew and Lexi always are together or partner up in everything,1
Love to see the squad back together 😊,1
"This song never gets old. No matter how much I listen, I never get bored.",1
I will forever and ever love Rihanna 🙌 this was my fav era but her art will always continue to shine in any time!,1
"this song really brings nostalgic feeling to me, remembering how I enjoy this Rihanna music and she's been a big part of my younger days! Thank you Riri for this masterpiece!



P.S. so addicted to this song again now!",1
The way she sang was so touching ! I tried to sing like her só many times playing with my guitar!!,1
I hate how most people forgot about this masterpiece. It's one of her best songs ever.,1

U DESERVE A TV SHOW!! We all want to see Drew on a big screen tv right?? So proud of u. Mom,1
"LOVE that you did this. Not a lot of home decor/DIY content creators show the small yet important things like how to make a bed look like it came out of a magazine, so really appreciate you doing that!! More small/simple yet so important things, please! Much love.",1
"Nice beds.  If you like the bed sheets to look crisp, like they were just ironed, make the bed and then lightly mist spray the sheets (including the pillowcases) with plain water, using a standard spray bottle.  This works on cotton sheets, which will stretch out as the mist of water dries out.  It is a luxury hotel trick.  The sheets will look pristine, especially white sheets.",1
"I LOVE this descriptive talk-through format of the video. For us less design-inclined mortals, it is incredibly insightful to hear your breakdown of the reasoning and choices! :)",1
"Oh Drew! I loved all of these stylings, but felt that the 3rd one just tied in all of the colors of your room, especially the dark paneling. And the 4th one added a soft warmth & great texture. Would you PLEASE do a similar video for window treatments? Styling different curtains patterns & colors,  with the rods, etc? I would love to see all the different ways you would style a window😍.",1
"Drew: Not all these designs look perfect in this space. 
Designs: all look perfect in the space 😍 I love it I'm a big fan of your videos.",1
"Flat sheet always goes “face down” so that when you open the bed to get in, you see the pattern (top and bottom) and you are getting “into” the pattern.  These are all so gorgeous!",1
"id watch 5 more of these. bed styling is so interesting to me, would love a part 2!",1
Hi Drew!  Loved how you styled the bed!!  Picked up a lot of tips I'm going to try.  I would love to see you style a buffet.  That's an area where I have a little trouble.  Would love any tips you could give.  Thanks!  Have an awesome day!,1
"Regardless of what you think about Chris, you can't deny his talent. This boy produces pure fire in the booth",1

"That’s my jam, way back in 2007.",1
It's a shame they don't make music like this no more,0
Sisqo sang the HELL outta this song. I remember being 10 years old when this masterpiece came out and I gotta say this was by far the best era for r&b music. They just don't make songs that hit like this anymore.,1
You could hear EACH one of their voices come together! True talent! Harmonizing 🔥,1
Gosh...I can remember watching Sysco when he was a teenager working at the Fudgery in Baltimore's Harbor Place performing while making fudge.  He drew such a crowd.  Everyone who walked by would just stop what they were doing because he just had a way of drawing you in.  It's so nice to see that they still have that ability.  That's what you call TALENT!,1
The part when they do the bounce  though 🔥🔥🔥😂😂,1
Sisqo had million dollar voice....purely platinum,1
Music doesn’t give me this feeling anymore.    Omg.,0

"This is how I will remember Amy. Healthy, glowing, thick, confident, cheeky and happy. She was at her PRIME during those Frank-era days. Frank was the perfect mix of pure Jazz and R&B. ",1
"11 years passed already, time flies. She was so authentic and genuine, full of the special talent, rest in peace Amy ❤️",1
"Frank was a bomb ass album great lyrics with infectious beats and sassy themes. Amy was enjoying her music then and being a musician, the fame and limelight was there yet. After this album the critique and scrutiny awakened her many insecurities I guess. Sigh but what a talent, she was great!!!",1
"She was soooo healthy here, hair healthy, skin healthy, body healthy, just so youthful and ripe for the world!!!  Man, I wish we could have gotten more time with her.",1
"kinda sucks how people mostly talk about how they wish she was healthy, and how unhealthy she was... Just listen to her voice and seal your lips. Her voice will speak to you and the composition will answer your questions, just let go of wishing something better...",0
"First time I heard this song, I was floored. It's both timeless and avant-garde. Ordered the album immediately.",1
WOW! First time hearing this song from her and this beat is sick.,1
Such a tragic loss. This poor baby never had a chance will all the vultures surrounding her. Thanks for gems like these!,0
This man is still killin it after so many years 🙌,1
"I'm not sure if a lot of people really understand how gifted this dude is..He is yet to do a song that I don't like. He can sing. He can write songs. Best dancer right now as far as I'm concerned. He can act. And he can create wicked visual art. I think if he didn't have that cloud over his head that a lot can't move on from, people would really see a new King of R&B",1
"How can you not be his fan, he is just so gifted. He puts so much of his heart in his music!",1
"I know 3 legends in my life, and they're
1.Chris Brown 
2. Christopher Maruce Brown
3. Breezy 
Hands down 👌",1
"He will go down as one of the best, most creative artists ESPECIALLY with music videos. 🔥 #teambreezy",1
"This is Chris Brown at his best! He has mature is so many ways and I love it!  This album is phenomenal! I play it my car, when I’m relaxing in a bubble bath sipping on a glass of Pinot Grigio🍷 he’s proving to be the king of R&B",1
Ooh Damn Damn...I just realized Chris is 30 years now..that means we probably got like 10 years more to see his ass in this industry..Mahn this guy ain't gon fade anytime soon,0

"I gotta give props to the admin for looking out. He was telling them off at first, but the next minute, he was like if anyone is stream sniping, let me know and Ill do something about it. Cool guy",1
That admin truly understands Soup will bring popularity to the server and is looking out for the guys against stream snipers. Massive respect to that admin,1
"As a Soup fan from the Rust timeline, I appreciate these actual half roleplay experiences. The cool admins and high pop cool servers are very nostalgic of the early Good Ole Boy himself.",1
"Once again!! Soup is really becoming a huge part of this server and it’s so funny to see. It’s got so much lore too, he just inserted himself.",1
Soup you never failed to keep me entertained through the years,1

I swear this guy is so funny it puts a smile on my face,1
2:03 just perfect I loved it so funny keep up the good work.,1
I will not tolerate you disrespecting my brothers with your nose candy..,0
"It was so satisfying hearing Jane almost crying. The fact that she randomly brought in race to the conversation, says a lot of her character.",1
bro its actually sad how that lady just brought up race without anything leading to them doing it because of race,0
"Trolling Jane was so worth it, her reaction was golden",1
Jane sounds like the kind of person you dont want to have a conversation with. Everything would be turned into race. 🤣,0
"Jane was so but hurt over ""disrespecting"" a brother 😂😂😂💀💀",0
I like how Jane thought she was some hero in the call when everyone just looked at her with embarassment. It was so bad that even subtrist got out of character,0
"that racist jane was so hilarious ""DISRESPECTING A BROTHER"" LMAO ""YOU DISRESPECTED THE BROTHER""",0

Just a compilation of my funniest clips this year (so far),1
still cant believe you got james to stop talking💀,0
This is so immature but for some reason it’s so entertaining. Probably because it’s so incredibly easy to avoid trolls like this and these people get so mad rather than just handle it.,0
When JJ just kept saying “Hey JJ just kinda throwing himself in here” and “Not trying to throw you against a wall” was some of the funniest things ever,1
"James and Lucy are hilarious, the way he turns and menacingly stares into the camera and goes “Get out.” and then Lucy going, “There is something wrong with your computer, you have a computer virus.”",0
James is one of the most terrifying people I've ever seen on Zoom,0
"Man, I really wish we had more polite people like James.",0
"3:34 the way he stared directly into the camera with that concerned expression and ominous music playing and said ""Get out."" made me literally laugh out loud so hard",1
"""Just because your bald doesn't mean you have to be mad at everyone""",0
“I don’t mean to punch you in the face here and absolutely break ur skull.” 💀 LOL,0
Can we honestly just appreciate how much effort Liger puts into his videos?,1
I was at the live stream and I loved how everybody blamed doni lmao,1
"""The chat was going crazy, I had to see the reaction.""
The chat: completely incomprehensible screaming",0
"Liger great video!

But there was 1 flaw that maybe next time you could fix. You see we couldn't freaking see the chat 70% of the time.",0
So sad I missed the whole stream. But this idea is so good lmao I burst out laughing everytime the chat is triggered 🤣,1
I like how the chat is like “ you win liger “,1
i love how in the thumbnail everyone was confused even Doni Bobes was confused,1
This was hilarious! Keep going!,1

"bbh actually still cares for skeppy no matter how many times he trolls him
that's just wholesome, being friends for a decade",1
we need more of this! skeppy managed to pull off this troll so well.,1
"This is a great way to scare bbh instead of using a normal troll, it's perfect",1
The scariest part of this video is Skeppy leaving all those floating trees.,0
That fear in Bad’s scream at the end was 100% genuine lol,1
"hi skeppy, im having a really crappy day today and i just wanted to thank and appreciate all the effort/work that you put into all your videos. they always help me out and especially today because one of the pets i own ((a cat)) passed away this morning. not looking for sympathy just wanted to thank you for your amazing videos. they really got me through today with tears and laughs. rest easy squidward.  thanks again, skep.",1

"It's scary to know he is actually being serious, you would honestly think this was a character he had made up 😂",0
"Ok this was so dumb and funny at the same time, LOL😂",1
At it again with the best content lol thank you for the laughs,1
"I hate to say it and i hope I don’t sound ridiculous but i don’t know who this man is. I mean, he could be walking down the street, and i wouldn’t know a thing... sorry to this man.",0
The fact that he gave himself a full head of hair in a fantasy story of himself can never be not funny to me lmao,0

"I’m not into fortnite anymore, but this mans entire sense of humor and content is hilarious",1

You've did it again Jay. You made another good video.,1
As somebody who despises My Little Pony I approve of this video,0
"Gorloss is one of those guys that I would have as a friend, he is super chill.",1
Your channel is really awesome! I'm glad I subscribed! Your do a very softcore type of trolling/minging thats not destructive at all!,1
I got a bad feeling about jay doing experiments next thing you know he creates some kinda SCP pony,0
Almost hit the 10min mark :D,1
"Despite being a brony, I find this hilarious.

Though I find the CARTOON HORSE PROGRAM!! funny also, so, there's not accounting for taste I guess.

she’s definitely a candy corn,1
mowing one was wholesome at least he got a laugh out of the host,1
It would be nice to see a more intricate trolling video where you’ve been attending regular meetings and become a regular just to fuck it up. Or you host a meeting yourself and kick people for dumb reasons and get reactions 😂,0
I don’t know how Clive has been so patient with Sub after all these years,0
"Bravo Subtrist, bravo. I hope you live the best life ever lived my man.",1
Subtrist you are a YouTube legend. These videos never fail to make me burst out laughing. Keep the great stuff going.,1
It's more funny when you guys say subtle things and manage to stay in the rooms for longer like 2:40,1
Bro when that lady hyped up Kendrick’s new album I almost died 😭😂☠️ She does not strike me as the type to listen to kdot.,0

"Great to see subtrist spending time with the feminist community. In fact, he saved my 4 daughters from a fire last night in his Bugatti with Andrew Tate.",1
I felt bad for the old man. I personally would join his passion for philosophy,0
I'm 23 years old . And this is honestly hilarious. Reminds me of my high school days. Pretty funny content for such young kids lmao,1
"this was legendary, no matter what , andrew should look at this , i died laughing 😄😄😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣",1
“Yo joe your grandma is big as shit” got me dying💀,0
You know you'll have a good day when my man Subtrist uploads another banger,1
I wanted to thank subtrist for conducting a special speech on my daughter's zoom channel congratulating her on going back to an all girl's school. Andrew Tate even drove down to the school in his jeep and presented a specialized plaque to commemorate the end of Roe vs Wade.,1

Good thing about Chernobog is that you don't need to worry about running out of missiles coz it blows up before that.,1
I love how hunting down griefers has become a sport in GTA V. I love this.,1
Chernobog is best paired with a friendly jet. The combo absolutely dominates sky combat.,1
Imagine being a jet griefer not knowing the Chernobog's capabilities,0
appreciate what ya do for the GTA community ur damn hilarious and provide alot of tips and always willing to help out other players either that or troll them which at times I'll admit is fun.,1
Drop one that's half an hour long putther. Upload one where you're killing griefers in many ways from riding the train to using vehicles you don't normally use to trolling. 👍,0
Such a great YouTuber always makes me laugh love the edits amazing the way you use them keep up the great work Putther,1
"I get why people would get annoyed if they were zoom bombed, but it was ridiculous how SS was accusing y'll of being immature and childlike while she was talking like some 9 year old diva.",0
THE WAY SHE JUST SAID OKAY AFTER YOU TOLD HER NO PROMOTING💀💀,0
"I love how she tries to make fun of them, and no one in the call laughing at her jokes",1
She's the type of person who puts a makeup on her forehead to make up her mind,0
That first woman literally looked insane,0
I'm glad soup is doing more rp again. Its what brought me to his channel on the first place.,1
"I love how everybody with an ounce of authority in these rp servers just know who you are now, you're like their boogeyman lol",1

I love seeing these children get so mad over their precious RP server rules getting broken. Shit kills me.,0
"Towing people is literally all I do in GTA rp. It’s too funny, especially when they’re in the car when you’re towing it.",1
"When soup uploads a new video, you know your day is gonna be great",1
I'm loving these 30 minute long gta trolling vids,1
I've waited for so long to see you guys troll people with a tow truck. lol,0
I couldn’t stop laughing at the absolute chaos halfway through. Soup you are an RP legend.,1
Actually to think about it soup literally never breaks his character and that’s the aggravating part for everyone involved lmao,0
"The amount of risk and effort he puts in this videos is insane, he is such a legend, I'm not even lying.",1
Imagine threatening to murder someone over zoom bombing,0
I lost it when the police started laughing and homeboy had to get up,0

Let's appreciate how he is making us happy and suffering from those ODErs 💀💀,1
Respect to this guy who was brave enough and had the stones to do that to expose orders 👏👏,1
He has been online dating for 3 minutes straight we should appreciate how brave he was 😭😭😭😭,1

the guys screams for help when the boats spawned had me dead💀😭,0
You can feel the emotions on his voice... I can't stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣 this guy has freaking talent bollywood talent 👏,1
Who has a more annoying voice Lucas or Omrilol?,0
"This isn't the Lucas we asked for, but it's the Lucas we deserve from time to time. 10/10, would have him in video again.",1
"I'd love to know how many people have bought Rust based on how fucking funny your videos are. 

I don't know how you find all these characters, but they are all amazing.",1
"As a spanish talker I can tell you this guys were hilarious! haha, they were extremetly confused and when they were talking in spanish they were just talking about how weird and funny Omrilol was hahah",1
"this was the best admin trolling video ive seen, ever, and its all coz of Omrilol, what a role playing legend",1
What a great actor. I hope he gets paid lmao,1
"I rarely burst out laughing, y’all had me laughing out loud multiple times; this is a hilarious video. 10/10",1
This is traumatizing and I'm here for it,0
theres a chance that half of the viewers of this video probably dont even know some of the nextbot's origins,0

Let’s take a moment to appreciate the other chill feminists in the vc,1
"As a woman, his argument is completely valid. It takes two to tango and if one member gets pregnant then they BOTH have to discuss further progress. You cant just get pregnant with someone's child and go off and abort. Unless is was an assault situation (in which the woman has ABSOLUTE control of what comes next because thats a horribly traumatic event) The woman has to go over proceedings with the Man",0
as a member of the nico community we need to get rid of her,0
"if anything, I feel bad for Nico. Being so paranoid and insecure that she automatically assumes everyone is harassing her, regardless of what's being said. Even someone with the same name was enough to make her feel threatened. Must be so draining, you know? No wonder she sounds like she's always on the verge of tears. She's also a discord mod, so no surprise there. I hope she gets the help she needs.",0
"“If abortions are legal, how come British people are still born” is probably  the best pro life argument I think I’ve heard.",1
Calling someone “racist” or “-phobic” with no evidence to back it up shows true ignorance.,0
"""Joe your grandma BIG AS SHIT DAWG"" Had me dying.",0
Why does Derrick have a pad on his forehead 💀💀,0
i'm literally dying of laughter this guy is so funny,1
Its always a good day when Nico uploads!,1
"This video was funny as shit, the long drawn out trolling is funnier imo",1
This is a certified hood classic,1
that woman having a mask on on an online meeting is one of the most ridiculous things i've seen in a while what does she think she'll get out of it?,0
These kid cops are out of control 😂,0
never fails to entertain me,1
13:50 this man folowing rp rules is a legend,1
"Another great vid Icy, first kid was too funny!",1
Thank you for stopping by put outlawrp I love your content and I'm sorry for breaking character I just couldn't believe that you came to my server,1

This episode was truly hilarious and just like old times,1
"Wish Soup would start his own lobby, become admin, cause chaos and then just wait for them to call an admin(him)",0
"Seeing you, Trippy and Yumi all play together is hilarious",1
Yumi is the best addition to RP trolling,1
I gotta say I absolutely Love watching every single one of these and I hope it never stops,1
Soups laughter is hella contagious 💀,1
"Thanks for this, Owen! Watching this guy lose his poop constantly on one hand is entertaining, but he is doing real damage to unsuspecting people  who have fallen for his rhetoric... As a Christian, people like him make the saner ones among us cringe constantly. I do not expect everyone to believe, but we all have to live together and need to treat everyone with dignity & human kindness. There is no place in our society for this kind of hate!",0
"I have to admit, this is hilarious. However, it's also sad. 

The fact that there's a remote possibility of this guy (or anyone for that matter) truly believing in this crap is disheartening and makes me lose faith in humanity. 

Really sets us back a few hundred years...

Also, if the devil were real,, this guy would undoubtedly be doing his bidding and not that of any loving God by preaching hate and encouraging division amongst people",0
As an actual witch I find it absolutely hilarious that this “burning service” of his resembled a ritual in almost every way,0
"This is obviously terrifying, but... Can we just take a moment to appreciate the fact that he is attempting to cleanse objects of negative energy with the element fire? That's legit one of the witchiest acts of witchcraft out there, lmao.",0
"As a “real” witch, complete with all of my spell books and tarot cards, I think it’s absolutely hilarious how the witch paraphernalia that he was burning was just Maleficent and Harry Potter merchandise. Lmao",1
"As someone who got away from an unknown ""prophetess"" who shared a similar view, it's scary that he actually has a following. While it is hilarious, and admirable someone trolled their book burning, I find it scary.

Since that only served to strengthen and prove him right in his mind, and in his following. I'm just scared if they actually start to become dangerous. To that man and us, it's a trolling joke, but to those people and Greg, it's real and not a game.",0
Dude the british kid went from an annoying kid to an absolute chad in the span of a few minutes honestly props to him for trolling with soup,0
I love how there are just 2 types of RP players. The hardcore nerdy ones that are dead serious and those like soup that just have fun annoying others,1
Dude that little damn british kid killed me with the nerve endings thing 💀,0
"The British kid is amazing 
""Oh no, I tickled His little nerve endings"" killed me",1
This made my little nerves ending tickle. One of the best/funniest RP so far,1
"""And then we stab her, in the neck."" Soup was spot on calling him a Bruv.",0

Lmao yessss I love the RP nerd trolling like Star Wars and Harry Potter,1

Thanks for posting such good quality content always 🤩,1
"9:45 Gibi: ""I like singing a lot, maybe not for you but you also could try.""
Actually same 😀, I also sing a lot when I want to relax/let stress go, most of the times I do it unconsciously, and I've learned a lot of songs perfectly word by word doing it through the years 😆, both Italian and English ones 😎.

I really appreciate how you talked about stress in this video, everything you said about it, your personal experience with it, how you deal with it/let it go, and especially all the little advices you gave us, stuff like this can be very helpful 😊.

I also really enjoyed all the triggers of course 😌, the iconic asking for consent about touching the viewer's face at the beginning, the stress pulling with the camera sometimes focusing on your hand and staying on it while it was moving back, which I tought looked really cool, the sound of the scissors snipping, the little sponge, everything, thank you as always Gibi 😀.",1
The nostalgia of the 4k videos is back they're really amazing to watch especially with the mic brushing it always puts me to sleep thank you so much Gibi ❤️,1
this was oddly perfect timing 😧 i’m getting a few of my gcse results in abt 11h and needed the stress relief💞 my saviour gibi,1
i honestly really needed this after spending the past few days stressing out! your videos in general are just super helpful with my anxiety and i can literally feel myself relaxing by the minute,1
I know some creators can get too repetitive with their content but your expansion on this idea is simply brilliant and people like me get to benefit from your amazing and relaxing work,1
"Seriously, this woman's imagination NEVER runs dry. ✨

All her RPs, especially The 'Your Hair Is' series, have really shown us all how inquisitive and ingenious Female ASMR really is! I feel like her originality not only gives pleasure, but also inspires many other people to put on their own thinking caps. Along with that, she seems to herself enjoying making these types of videos, which personally, makes me enjoy them even more! And honestly, I can't wait to see more unique n amazing posts from her. Much love to you as well, Female. I hope you're doing well, too. Stay safe, and do keep up the spectacular work!! (^ v ^)//☆

Fred is destroying me so hard with his pro gamer tingles that I don’t know whether to relax or rage,0
I usually skip the sponsors but this guy puts so much effort into making his sponsorship announcements so fun I can't help but watch,1
This is making me miss my gaming days but love the tingles absolutely wonderful😍❤️❤️,1
"Ironic that a Gameboy, a console which used to keep me up all night is being used to put me to sleep now lmao

Wonderful video as always Fred!",1
"I feel happy and relaxed even while watching the sponsorship announcements :) 

He is the only one who can say “You’re welcome” even in commercial.",1
I think fred got in such good shape just from being so exuberant moving around in his videos. Great work,1
"I love it that he puts his hobby's in his video's, i like it that you can see that asmr isn't the only thing he has in his life, but also has a life outside his career and that he likes to share his passion 😄",1
The amount of energy and effort you put into all of your super relaxing videos is on full display in this one for sure!,1
I'm getting flashbacks to the finger cramps you could get when you sat with a Game Boy for an entire day. But this is amazing.,1
"first time getting into watching the asmr gaming kinda videos, been into asmr things for about 5years idk WHY i havent watched these sooner, this was actually super enjoyable and entertaining to watch hell yea ! :)))) loved it",1
I love how he randomly used obama as a trigger word 😂,1
"sometimes i come here to sleep, sometimes i come here for commentary, sometimes i come here for gameplay. you really have it all and i love watching someone who’s passionate abt what they do and is as much of a geek as i am! keep up the incredible work :D",1

The production quality was great and the reflections off the rims of the glasses and your lips were spot on.,1
"Well hello art Queen! 🔥  I like the look for today, exquisite and cultured 🤩🤪 My niece made a drawing of me for me a few months ago, I would say it was cute but also very terrifying 😂",1

"Hey Kelly, I don’t really write any comments but I just want to say thank you for helping me to sleep, to relax every single night. I love that you are uploading daily sometimes. And even if you take a week or whatever break from uploading, I can just watch any other video, even old ones because all of them are relaxing. My life is really stressful at the moment and I just want to thank you for helping me, even if you never knew, you did.",1
"I have two things that I would like to say: First, this video helped me get very relaxed for sleep! Thank you, Kelly! The second thing is that I really like that there aren't any negative comments in this community (at least not that I've seen). It's refreshing to see people being helpful and kind to each other for a change ❤",1
I love when you spray the body spray. Such a tingly feeling. Also I would love if you did another language trigger words video.,1
"Just popping in to say that I spent most of the last year really depressed and anxious so I found myself watching/listening to your videos more and more to sleep or calm me down. 

Recently, I’ve really turned a corner and I feel like I’m finally thriving again and I seriously feel like you helped me through that dark time. Like you are as important as my therapist and I love you so much!
Thank you for all the content, you’re a true healer, and even though I’m busy all the time now, I still need you for a good nights sleep! Sending love and good vibes to you and your lil family.

"something about your tapping is so amazing. it’s the sharpness, but not piercingly sharp, your nails and the way that it sounds like it’s echoing. perfection.",1
"as an ex flight attendant, this is INCREDIBLY detailed. especially the safety demo? gave me flashbacks. I wish I had been able to give the demo in a way as calming as you were.",1
"I love how when Gibi asks for options, she doesn't specify which one we pick. For example she asks ""Which one would you like?"" then she says ""Okay perfect"" and no matter what someone picks, it seems really interactive. Also love the attention to detail with the airplane cups! :) Thanks so much for the relaxation and content you provide for us <3",1
"I'd love a ""Everything is wrong"" version of this with us, the viewers, being the only ones on the flight and we're in a rusty old plane that could drop at any given point. Perhaps Daisy could be the flight attendant:)",1
"the attention to detail is unmatched. the background noise, the safety demonstration, EVEN THE CUPS WERE LIKE AEROPLANE CUPS!!",1
"i don’t even have any allergies but the consciousness of allergens is so comforting idk why 😭 i know it’s really scary traveling with allergies for you gibi, so i can imagine how nice it would be to hear those words from a flight attendant!!!",1
"The safety demonstration is one of my favorite in real life ASMR triggers! I always look forward to it and watch very intently on flights lol so I’m very happy to have this video to watch on repeat! 😂 The lighting and attention to detail is just flawless, Gibi you’re incredible💜",1
"The first ""First Class Flight Attendant"" roleplay from many moons ago is still one of my favorites to this day and gives me the best ASMR. I love theseeee 🥰🥰🥰",1
"Whoever's reading this, i pray that whatever you're going through gets better and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen",1
"8:53 was not prepared for her cat staring into my soul lol, also love this video ! its so relaxing!",1
"I’m a mental health tech at an inpatient psychiatry unit and I had a particularly rough day today and hearing you say “nobody needs anything from you right now” really hit hard. I love you for this video, Jocie thank you so much for everything you do.",1
"Perfect timing. I’m having a hard day, anxious and just overall sad. Lots of stress as of recent, just seeing your contagious smile the moment I clicked on YouTube made me feel better before even watching the video. You’re so appreciated Jocie. Thank you.",1
"JOCIE, you are STUNNING!! Your accessories and nails are so cute and the whole look makes the asmr sm more enjoyable! <33",1
I love how Jocie always wears such like comforting makeup,1

Hello Silke. Thank you for this. Lately I’ve been feeling a little depressed about working 60+ hours a week and not getting out on the boat all summer.  I actually really like this setting and the squawking gulls in the background. They always have to make their presence known 🤣.  Take care of yourselves and stay safe 🌲⛵️.  Hello Vanessa 😊,1
"Thank you so much for what you said here - it really cut through the mental clutter. Really helpful and insightful, great video as always!",1
"I really like what you said about not being able to change people, but simply having acceptance of a situation. Videos do wonders, keep doing em!!",1
I love how spirit works. Last night I was searching for a reiki video for releasing resentment. Less than 24 hours later this video pops up in my subscriptions. Thanks so much 💖,1
"Thank you! This session led me to a breakthrough in my perspective about people that prove not to be looking out for me. It's important to know who truly is for me, and walk away from those that are not. 
In fact, I had already walked away, but I had some residual negative thoughts/feelings about the situation. Now I can see how it actually prompted me to level up!
 Now I'm grateful everything worked out the way it did!  I'm in a better situation and I'm improving on a personal level. Silke, thank you for helping me let go of the negative energy! ❤️",1
"Thank you so so so much for making this video! I’m so comforted by this, and I’m so grateful! ❤️",1
I never thought wednsday would become one of my favorite days. Thanks Silke ☺️🙏,1
I'd like to suggest a session to attract more luck and bring more good fortune and positive vibes into our lives🍀,1

"I saw on Gibi's Twitter that this video made the person who subtitled it fall asleep, and after watching it, there's no wonder why, I almost did the same, but I got to the end cause I didn't want to miss anything. All these soft relaxing sounds were so good 😌, I especially enjoyed the plush watermelon borrowed from Satine, the small brush, and all the whispering of course! Thank you Gibi 😊.",1
"I love the part where she says “It’s Gibin’ time,” and everyone falls asleep.",1
"This right here is such classic, vintage Gibi that I'm surprised she didn't bust out the ol' 3-DIO and put on the headphones. 😴💤",1
"Hey Gibi, I don't know if you'll even see this but I really appreciate your videos. I went through something very sad and difficult 4 months ago yesterday. I won't explain what I'm going through and how I feel, mainly because I don't think I can find the words to describe it. Anyways, I just started watching your videos a couple days ago and your content is the only thing that has managed to calm me down enough to sleep. Thank you so much ❤",1
The velvet boxes make a return!! love those little guys. The “pitter patter” while tapping on the box sounded nice too! Real cozy vibes ^_^,1
Putting this here so whenever anyone reacts to it I'll be reminded of this masterpiece :),1
My favorite part is when she uploaded. She always makes my day like the thousands of others here too :),1
"The soft crinkling noise from the watermelon sounds like a crackling bonfire and I absolutely love it! I need a whole video of just that item on loop, lol.",1

I'm impressed with the  mouth sounds and the way you make them cloud.,1
The fast wet mouth sounds were really intense and tingly :),1
"This was really good!! 🌸✨🤗✨🌸 Loved the kisses and the tongue clicking especially, but all of the mouth sounds were superb!!",1
"The first slow to fast mouth sound video I've seen, and it did not disappoint. Love you and your videos. Both gems 💎",1
This is great☺🔥😴😃,1
"Ayee this vid was AMAZING! Don’t worry about the noises in the back, in a way it adds a bit of trigger plus i bet we were all concentrated on the mouth sounds😝- From 1#",1
"Not much to say this time....you left in awe with this exceptional video Crystal😭🔥Hoensty, how can somebody be this perfect and amazing at what they do...cheers to you👏🏻👏🏻Nevertheless, best wishes for this upcoming fall semester and may luck be on your side, Love you fr💛",1
The worst part is you spent so much time making an incredible deep and intricate lore that is intertwined thru hundreds of videos... and i dont think ive stayed awake thru even 10% of the videos ive watched...,0
"At this point, we should all be proud to be born in the exact time period and multiverse as Uncle Rift.",1
"This guy makes the weirdest concepts for videos, like he's literally making a statues out of your flesh, and he makes it relaxing
In all seriousness, keep up the good work!",1
ER could literally make a video about paint drying and I would enthusiastically watch it at this point,1
"Not only is Uncle Rift good at ASMR, storytelling and photography, but he's also skilled in sculpting?! Thus man will never cease to amaze me...",1
"Honestly, I have no more guesses on the next video, this man can do literally anything",1
"I've learned English with his videos. The first video I saw was one the first iggy manly's.( to this day the og iggy videos have this type of ""sharp"" voice and are my fav's). But I always listen to him while doing homework. I got myself better headphones to watch his videos and listen to them in better quality. Really can not say enough to thank this Man, with a big ""M""",1
"Happy to be one of the first viewers on this one. Been watching this channel since 2014, you’ve always reigned my favorite ASMRtist. Excited to watch the video, what a classic concept. 🤘",1
"Lattes eyes are so kind. It’s like she’s saying “it’s ok, I’m here” just by eye contact",1
The fact that the windows get darker progressively is a sign of how attentive to detail Latte is. Amazing work!,1
"Latte, would you ever consider doing a behind the scenes of your ASMR filming process? I am so fascinated by how detailed your sets are, how perfect you make them, and how you embody every aspect of the role you’re playing for these ASMR videos. It’s incredible! I’d love to see a behind the scenes of you setting up and filming! I think many others would, too! 😍❤️🥰",1
"latte is so incredible. i am a teen and struggle with anxiety, depression, ocd, adhd, paranoia, body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria, ptsd, and dissociative issues as well as chronic pain, so it is usually very difficult for me to feel relaxed and fall asleep. i discovered latte two years ago and it changed my life. she is so soothing and comforting without being condescending, annoying, or repetitive and her videos are always incredibly high quality. i’ve watched all of her videos (including the ones in languages i don’t understand) and there wasn’t a single video i didn’t like. i love and appreciate latte so much <33",1
"The airline realness here is out of this world. The white china, the way the food is plated, the picture on the back wall.... It's just outstanding.",1
"I, and hopefully other people, would love to see a “behind the scene” of the making on of these videos!!!",1
"This woman is one of the few asmr tists who got exactly the concept and mastered the practice. Some asmrtists, as fine as they are, do not have the sensibility to sometimes avoid some triggers or noises that can actually bother the most sensitive listeners. There are patterns of sounds, which means some sounds will cause relaxation, other sounds might bother one same person and many youtubers don't realize that these cannot be mixed. Me, for an example, hate very high pitched noises, hate plastic and eating sounds. Latte could never have a disturbing plastic noise on her videos. She just knows what's up.",0
Whenever you tell us to breathe in and breathe out it INSTANTLY relaxes me. You are the only ASMR person that has given me complete relaxation in such a simple manner. Your voice is just perfect for this....,1
"latte is so passionate, she even bought a plane for us 🥰",1
Omg I just noticed that the sun is setting outside the windows… The attention to detail Latte puts into every video is just incredible❤️,1
C’est incroyable de faire des vidéos d’une qualité folle tous les jours !merci à toi de m’endormir tous les soirs! Bonne nuit à tous😴,0
très bonne vidéo j'ai découvert ta chaîne il y a pas longtemps franchement pas déçu continue comme sa ❤️,1
"Pour répondre à ta question je sais qu'il y a de plus en plus de téléphone qui ont le binaural (dont le miens) et ça marche très bien, même sans casque 😊

Sinon très bonne vidéo comme d'habitude 🥰",1
C est une très bonne idée de vidéo 🔥✌️💡 Franchement très relaxant🤌🤌,1
J’ai quand même pris mes écouteur ahah. Le micro est tellement bien !! j’ai encore kiffe la vidéo comme dab 😘,1
"Les 10k sa va vite , elle sont superbes tes vidéos continue le stick 👍",1

One night of me having sweets and I have a food baby already",0
Can we just appreciate how she is willing to get lots of cavities for us! <3 ☺️😇,1
Kudos to you hun! My teeth have seen their day or i would join you doing some of this stuff. Way to go!,1

"Thank you for not putting in ads. Like imagine listening to this at night and then just hearing; ""writing is not that easy, but grammarly can help""",1
I’ve never seen such a long preview this just proves that this asmrist really puts in the effort for us,1
Just take the time to appreciate that she took the time to make a three hour asmr video and put the timestamps in two different languages *and* with no ads,1
"The fact that she takes her time so that we can hear more outstanding noises/sounds.
She also puts a decent amount of time in to every sound.
And she takes her free time to get herself ready prepare everything that she wants to use and then spend over 3 hours for us🥺🤗",1

"READ ME: I forgot to answer the first question on the screen!! I'm sorry!!! My answer is: I'd rather pick talk to animals, even if it wasn't a perfect communication, would be unbelievable to be the only person who could do that!!! Sorry, hope y'all see this before getting mad at me for skipping it LOL

ALSO
I reference ASMR Galaxy's channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnYMUrv4Fw0&t=678s&ab_channel=ASMRGalaxy
if you love watching Would You Rathers/iPad sounds!! This video is directly inspired from theirs! :))) Definitely check them all out, so many great videos!!!",1
"Your handwriting is so amazing, it’s actually visual ASMR for me",1
"OMG, now you gotta make this into a series. Your ipad videos (I remember the first one with testing out brushes) was the reason why I started my ASMR channel. Now i’m expecting a large series with 5+ parts of would you rather lovely. You’re the BEST! ❤❤❤❤ thank you for the mention; i don’t think i even deserve it! 🥹",1
"Love so much that you're a jojo fan. What a relaxing video, I love the tapping sounds!",1
My life is complete knowing that gibi has used one of my examples lol 😂,1
Can we just talk about how nice Gibi’s handwriting is!,1
Couldn’t get enough of the iPad tapping sounds. These questions were great. Would like a sequel. Possibly with some original characters. Would be interesting to see Officer Barts answers to some of these questions.,1
"It’s currently midnight even though I’m so tired I know it’s worth it and I already know it will, love your vids! Keep em up :) and goodnight  everyone",1
The ipad tapping sounds really good! The writing too! I really like this background since it helps me watch it before I sleep!,1
"""Hope y'all see this before getting mad at me for skipping it LOL""
I personally wouldn't get mad for something like that 😆, but still, I'm glad I've read the description first before watching the video like I always do 😊.",1
"my mom used to play one of these with me!  ours was growing a vegetable patch.  you would till the soil, and make the rows, then planting the seeds and naming each type of veggie as you went, then covering the seeds with dirt, and then rain falling over them all and sunshine shining on them to help them grow TT u TT  very good childhood memories indeed.  these were great to listen to, thank you so much for sharing and triggering a lot of us in the best of ways.",1
"Erin: ""They bite you! They bite you!"" 
Me: *is relaxed and sleepy*.

"I love the clear, visible and audible pleasure Erin takes in lines like ""it's a snake and it attacks!""",1
"I haven't thought of these since my mom passed away when I was young, since she used to this to help me sleep at night. This was really relaxing and these were so nice to hear again.",1
The nostalgia on this was off the charts! My earliest ASMR experience as a kid (along with playing with hair) were these back tracing games.,1
"The version we did as kids where I live was honestly a bit weird. The direct translation would be: ""Three knives to the back, blood runs down, spiders crawling in your hair, snakes 'round your neck, crack an egg on your head and the yolk runs down-"" and then you'd usually say ""boo"" or something. Maybe lightly push the person as you're saying it too. 
So yea, pretty hardcore for a bunch of 6 year olds lol",0
"Such a nostalgic thing for me. My mom used to help me sleep with these every other night. In my country we call them ""wierszyki-masażyki"", which roughly translates to massage poems ^^ Loved the video!",1
this stuff is so interesting!! my version of the shiveries was so much shorter and had like half of the same elements. it's cool how much these things change from place to place and time to time,1
"“There’s an egg on your head and the yolk is running down … there’s a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down”

“I’m sleeping with Pam’s mom. Sometimes dinner”",0

"Being a british person myself, Gibi, an american, actually did a good job of doing a fairly convincing english accent as Robyn. Literally never thought i'd say an american would ever do that, but there ya go.


edit: thanks for 1.2K likes!",1
I LOVE that Robyn's signature is literally an X marks the spot!,1
"Sybil giving us some tea and essentials for the road is the cutest thing ever. She's so mumsy and this is why I love her, she's probably my favourite character in the Gibiverse 💗",1
No one talking about Pom-Pom? She's like someone who would sit and listen to you while in your darkest moments and when your bored she always has good ideas to help you. I love pom-pom and love to see more of her and Lorelei too.,1
The fact that no one’s talking abt Luna saying “want a quickie? Oh I shouldn’t say that!”,0
"can i say bart is just, an amazing addition to Gibi's world of characters",1
"Daisy: ""don't say hi to Lorelei. i owe her money""
pov character: *goes to Lorelei first and gives her a paper that says 'Daisy' and nothing else*

damn we savage",0
The most impressive thing about this video is the fact that each character has their own thought out and individual signature. That's some ACE character creation.,1
Leave a thumbs up👍 for your favorite trigger and goodnight💖,1
Let the anxiety melt away. Let the overthinking stop for awhile. You deserve relaxation. You deserve comfort. Be kind to yourself. Please. ❤️,1
Her nails be on point every single video and it’s so satisfying,1
The bassy sound of the lint comb is so unique. It's a weird but wonderful cross between a cat purring and a frog croaking.,1
"Your nail tapping  has the most unique sound, but the quality of your ASMR is what stands out the most, it is by far one of my essential can’t live without nightly routines",1
Ive been watching ASMR for years and Ive never had these kind of affects. Omg thank you so much. 💜,1
"Yes pleaseee right as I opened YouTube to fall asleep, literal perfect timing!! I don’t know if I’ve ever been this early haha, thank you for another super tingly video !",1
"Hope your nights have been well people. I know I personally struggle alot daily with anxiety and such, but it's always best to find something that calms you down at the end of the day. I hope those of you watching this for maybe your anxiety or insomnia find the necessary peace you need tonight. Struggle is just another path towards a new destination and you will meet the end eventually. From one challenge to another we keep growing. Anyhow, this message goes out to everyone. I hope you are all doing well and are safe somewhere tonight. Sleep well 💖",1

"Honestly, you could make anything sound nice Gibi. It’s YOU! the items you use are just a bonus.",1
Gibi “thinks” she’s got some things that will sound nice  😂 I’m quite confident they will be amazing ❤️,1
"The USPS store in my hometown is (atleast the times I've been in there) very quiet and simple- the workers are soft spoken and sweet, and I can't even remember music being played really. It's not an awkward quiet but a comforting one with a little bit of paper shuffling background noise :>",1
Her whisper voice is so clicky and precise and perfect and it’s so relaxing. i’ve never heard another asmrtist with such a satisfying natural voice.,1
"GIBI, the answer is always yes. We like EVERYTHING you do we want ALL the vids 😌",1
"1 - incredibly excited for the fairy post office!! (The tiny envelopes and wax seals!!)
2 - I adore the idea of a pen shop role play
3 - I like both show and tell and trigger videos. You should make whichever one you feel like at the time",1
"Your RPs are out of this world amazing (I’m still vibing from the Trojan War medical muse/lyre player), but as this video shows, and as we all know, just “plain” Gibi (excuse the oxymoron) isn’t too bad either! (Excuse the understatement.) Thanks for the Zs. EDIT follows:

Actually I should not say Gibi’s role plays are “out of this world”. They are in this world. They portray pieces of who we are, or want to be, or pieces of people we know or want to know, or of people we have met or want to meet, or of friends (or personal assistants) we have or want to have. And this is (just one reason) why they are so amazing.",1
"When you were talking about possibly doing a Fairy Post Office, I imagined it being inside of a flower. One soft color with little lights - either warm or cool depending on the color of the flower. 🌷💌",1
Why is his voice so calming it’s so normal but soft and cool at the same time never heard such a interesting and nice voice.,1
"it’s a little thing, but the consistency between haircuts is comfy. like when u rly get to know ur barber as a person",1
Your voice is so calming and you easily put me to sleep and that’s definitely not a bad thing. I couldn’t sleep until 2 AM. You just got a new sub 😆,1
"I have bad social anxiety and anxiety attacks and stuff and started listing to you at night now during the day if me anxiety sneaks up, I’m also a recovering addict and these video’s wee brilliant man thank you",1
Haircut ASMR is probably my favorite it's so satisfying,1
"Honestly, this guy have some of the most relaxing asmr,, I love this 💖💖
Keep it up bro... love from India 🇮🇳",1
Its amazing to see how much u have grown as a person that has been watching since 1.3k subs and im still loving it bro keep up the good work,1
"I’m a new subscriber, loved the video it’s so relaxing & tingly 🫶🏽🫶🏽",1
I love this man this is so relaxing keep up the amazing work!!,1
"The lap videos are always so amazingly comforting!
Love the little rings on your nails and the sound they make while you trace really nice video! 💕",1
"Glad to see you did this again, and you added long nails! These lap videos give me such a safe and cozy feel it makes me so sleepy before I can even finish the video.",1
10:11 Love that the camera focused just in time to see the confusion haha. Also those fingernail ring things (?) make a really great sound! Thanks for this pls tell your neck we're sorry.,1
Your ASMR is so calming and soothing ❤️❤️❤️,1
"listening to this with earbuds for the first time in a long time and it’s rly a whole new experience, it’s soooo good 🤭


edit: i used to listen to asmr without any earphones and was fine. for once i thought about using them. pls don’t be weird in the comments lol",1
"Just saw this came out, can't wait to hit the sack in a couple of hours and fall asleep to it. Thanks so much, love your videos.  ❤️😁🐶",1
Amazing visuals and her voice is amazing. This is so calming I will fall asleep in no time!,1
"This is super relaxing. I enjoy your positive affirmations, especially from this angle, as your comforting words combined with your lovely hand sways give lots of tingles. Thanks Glow ❤",1
"I love these types of Asmr videos, makes you feel so safe and relaxed",1
"Absolutely magnificent video, Glow. 🥰 Would love to see more of these.",1
"¡Después de todo la calidad es increíble!
this is really one of my favorite ASMR channels ✔️",1
The lofi apple mic is what brought me to asmr. It's still so tingly 🥰,1
"Your content is always so relaxing😴😴 like literally- I almost fell asleep after only one minute of this masterpiece!👌
I hope you know that we all rly appreciate you taking time out of ur day to make us happy ❤️🥺Love you so much! ❤️❤️",1
"He is an AMAZING asmr-artist and for his young age, wow he is just the best🙌 All love to you mate❤",1
Its so nice to see him smiling whenever he makes a tingly sound!,1
Goodnight everyone and sleep well! :),1
"Me encantan tus ASMR Lowe , eres el

Yay the asmr allways comes at the right time!!! I just returned from holiday and iam positive. Yall reading this have a good night!!🤧😊❤,1
"La forma de tus cejas son muy bonitas, y gracias por este gran ASMR ❤",1
💜 I got a few frequently asked questions in this vid so I answered them in the description! Ily 🤟,1
"i was DYING LAUGHING at all the background noise! even then, i loved your reaction to it. honestly it wasn’t even that bad :)",1
"The ""fuck off"" had me dying! I always love your ""follow instructions"" videos.",1
1:50 made me feel that tingly feeling between my eyes it was perfect.,1
The background noise actually added to the comfort for me because I felt like I was just hanging with a old friend at their place in the real world. The imperfection makes things feel safe,1
When you don't cut out background noises but use them as your advantage is the way of a true asmrtist,0
Getting that Raven feel with your hair color from Teen Titans! It looks rad! Love it 😍👍👍,1
"Thanks Luna Bloom. This really put me in such a relaxed, trance like state 😴",1
"I could honestly kiss the person who invented ""follow instructions"" type asmr. SO tingly! Hipnotize us with your light saber chopsticks Queen <3",1
Loving the new hair colour! Hope the move has been going well and that everything you've packed made it safely. Thanks for the video and have a good one.,1
"OMG believe me when I shouted ""Yesss!"" when I saw you guys together. I really liked the first two videos you made and I am currently listening the introduction part of the video, feeling very excited. Thank you so much for always bringing us amazing videos! Take care Soy.",1
"Omg I LOVE Seongmin!! I hope she does more! My favorites are when she uses the big brushes, like with the blush and powders. Sooo relaxing. Love her attention to detail",1
"OMG I remember the halloween makeup video!!! I'm happy that you collaborated again, she is so talented and sweet, and you're looking amazing!! Thank you for another very relaxing video ❤️🥰",1
"The theme of makeup was spectacular, real and cute. I also loved the delineation and the facial cleansing.🤗💖",1
"Love these kinds of  videos! BTW the girl which is doing your makeup is such an amazing person, she looks so kind, her voice is PERFECT for ASMR, she is so talented and she is so so pretty! Can't wait for more videos with her! 🤗🥰🤗",1
"Press thumbs up if you think Soy and Seongmin should create a YouTube account together and post videos regularly 😍 amazing job, girls! The makeup is flawless and the sound is incredible! Hope to see you two together in another collab soon!",1
Yaayy so glad to see you guys back again 💜 your make-up artist is made for asmr! Love from Australia x,1
"This exactly what I was needing 😭 I'm so stressed at work I've been wanting to watch some ASMR. However I couldn't find any good makeup video and I've watched yours so many times already! I am so thanksfull for this new video, this is my favorite kind of asmr 😍",1

Wspaniały występ ❤️ życzę Ci abyś  spełniała swoje marzenia .,1
Sara James has a fantastic singing voice. Sarah did Rocket Man so much justice. The atmosphere she set with her voice was beautiful. She's an instant finalist. And only 14 years old which is mind blowing! I’m always apprehensive about winners being that young and having to deal with the pressure but I definitely see her winning. 🎤🚀🇵🇱,1

"Is There Anybody Out There?	lyrics
____________________________===========
 	I climb the rooftops every morning
And search for life there down below
But there is nothing out there for me
There is nothing out there to see
I send a signal for survivors
Requesting help on where to go
But there is nobody else to hear
The only answer I get is fear

'Cause every time that I return to this place I once called home
Yes, every time the walls cry out, you're the last one - you're alone

Oh – is there anybody out there?
There must be someone else like me
Oh – is there anybody out there in the cold?
Come raise your voice and set me free

I wander streets that once were crowded
I'm searching houses that were homes
But there is nothing out there for me
There is nothing out there to see
I'm fighting off the dread that haunts me
But in my empty heart it grows
'Cause there is nobody else to hear
The only answer I get is fear

And every time I raise my head, panic stares me in my face
Yes, every time I try to think, I get trapped inside a maze

Oh – is there anybody out there?
There must be someone else like me
Oh – is there anybody out there in the cold?
Come raise your voice and set me free

Oh – is there anybody out there?
There must be someone else like me
Oh – is there anybody out there in the cold?
Come raise your voice and set me free",0

"POT FARMER DANCE SONG $$
I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot
You better believe it held a whole lot.
I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame
Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.

I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes
They did nothing but give me regrets.
My mom had arthritis could not walk around
I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.

I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack
 After I smoked some to me it came back.
Soon I decided prices were high
I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.

I bargained for seeds from smokers all around
 Got in my truck and drove out of town.
I walked through the woods where wild birds nest
 Found me the meadow I thought was the best.

I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds
Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds.
I watered at night with a five-gallon pail
 Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.

Seven months went by; I thought I would die
Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky.
At night I went out, in a camouflage suit
 Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.

I hung it up to dry where it couldn’t be found.
Came back and got it, when it had turned brown.
I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags
Called all my friends and passed out free drags.

In less than a week my crop was gone
 I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!

"I'm Chinese-Australian, and I started thinking about what my ideal comfort food would be when I started watching this video. It turned out that I had a very similar experience with the Chinese lady in this video as well. My parents sometimes made congee with cabbage and chicken in the morning and it was the best meal I could ever have wanted. I also requested this when I was sick and also when I got braces on (because I could only eat soft foods). It really shows just how nice this mixture of rice and water really is.",1
My comfort food is maggi..being an indian I literally grew up eating it..you can just eat it anytime..every indian loves it,1
"I'm Filipino and my favorite comfort food is called Bananacue, It's basically Banana covered with crunchy caramel but typically we don't use just normal Bananas, we use a kind of Banana called Sabah and its like Banana but bigger and a little bit firmer. Typically served on a stick but it's up to you on how you want it served.",1
"I'm polish and my comfort food is ""pierogi ruskie"".
It's dumplings with potato, cheese and garlic filling, boiled and then fried in bacon fat with crispy bits of bacon and sometimes caramelized onion sprinkled on top, with a bit of butter for that extra creamy taste.
I can eat them by kilograms!",1
"I don't know why everyone is disliking the British one, for me I think comfort foods means that you can have it all the time whether you're happy, sad, tired exhausted or energetic. Personally, I don't even like bread and toast but for him it might be his comfort food which he can have it all the time whenever he wants to, without even thinking about the preparations to make for a grand food. xx",0
"Being British the best comfort food is at Chinese takeaway their bbq sweet ribs are PERFECT they fall off the bone and you get to eat the sweet crunchy cartilage (and if  you like it the bone marrow) it’s perfect to eat and the sauce in the tub left over in thick and sweet and perfect for the chips they sell that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Hope I described it well

Edit: ALSO MARMITE AND CHEESE INBETWEEN 2 PIECES OF TOAST JUST JJEJJSJSJSJSJJSSJISISJENJD",1
A fellow Mexican here and I have two different comfort foods. For when I want something sweet I go with arroz con leche because its good for any time of the day and can be eaten cold or hot which means it's good for literally any time of the year. And my other comfort food is definitely pozole it is just so good and warm and it gives me memories of all the parties I went to when I was a child.,1
Does anyone else watches these videos as a torture challenge while you're hungry as hell?,0
"As a native Chicagoan I can safely say Portillos is pretty great. The Italian beef and their crinkle fries are both so so good! However as someone who visits Missouri yearly you can never say no to Lions Choice. It puts Arbys to shame with real roast beef, gotta get it with Swiss and au jus with a fountain IBC root beer! It doesn’t get much better than that!",1
"I loved your list! really well put together. having lived in WA, and born in Oregon I can attest that both restraunts are very important to us",1
"As a Native Idahoan, I can attest to the fact that Boise Fry Company is AMAZING!!! They have a buffalo burger that is divine and I prefer the purple, yam, or sweet potato with Fry sauce and blueberry ketchup.",1
"I was born and raised in Anchorage, and I can all but guarantee you that while Tommy's is at-best pretty standard, it's an absolute tourist trap and has been since I was born (in 1993). Go to Long Branch Saloon for burgers, and if you want a more ""Alaskan experience"" try to go for a salmon quesadilla from Salmon Express during Saturday Market. My recommendation is to order it spicy but even getting a regular is going to be excellent even if you're not big on seafood.",1
"Went to North Carolina for my cousin's wedding back in October 2018. Mentioned that we were going to go to Bojangles the following day. We had two people at our table that were close friends of the bride and groom (the groom being my cousin). They immediately got excited and told us we had to go there. It holds the record for being the only place whose biscuits I love.

I am a native Seattleite and have had likely hundreds, if not thousands, of Dick's burgers, fries, and shakes throughout my life. In high school, we had them for lunch every Saturday. Good times, good times...",1
That was an awesome list and I agree with all of the places that I’ve been to personally. Can’t wait to try the ones I’ve never been to,1
"Another fun facts, Burgerville is the first fast food chain in the US to be unionized, just a couple years back. Also the spicy bean burger is amazing. 
<3",1
This seems like a list that only talks about restaurants that were founded in any given state....I want a list that actually confirms what everyone's fav fast food restaurant is regardless of where it was founded. :),1

This is a different Pakistan that media shows me. Thanks best ever food review show for showing us the real Pakistan and its peaceful people. Sending love from the Philippines!!!!,1
"This was the absolute best! Some genuine laughs, some dark humor...this is what close minded people need to see- your videos in general. Shutting down all stereotypes, learning & gapping culters-bring us all together..Even in some failures. Love this stuff ya guys 🤙👍",1
I officially have made Pakistan my Number 2 food destination after Uzbekistan....thank you Sonny for keeping us entertained and learned always.....,1
I want to go to Pakistan JUST to eat food with Ali. I really enjoyed his personality - he's got a great sense of humor and he's obviously super passionate about educating  people on the beauty of his country.,1
Im a carnivore so Pakistan is the place for me for the meat. Everything looked so good and the host were awesome. Sonny does a great job of bringing the food and culture of Pakistan and its people to the forefront. Was interesting and very informative to watch. Lots of fun too. Great video,1
"That mountain town is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen . The buildings , the scenery, the food, the health of the people. Incredible . I’m jealous . That life style seems so simple and fulfilling.",1
"The Hunza Valley part was absolutely beautiful…. Simple untouched by anything from the outside world…. Gorgeous simple people, scenic beauty and fabulous hosts….. fantastic fantastic vlog…. Amazing presentation of a hidden culture",1
"Pakistan Tourism owes a great deal to you for revealing hidden gems such as Hunza Valley. 
Greetings from India",1
"This is one of your best Sonny.. Loved the content and the video. God bless Pakistan, it's beautiful people, rich culture, mouth watering homely food and mostly importantly Sonny for bringing this to us. ❤❤❤❤",1
"As a European who loves Italian-style pizza, one of my culinary dreams is to travel to New York to try their pizza, but also to Chicago to try the deep dish. One awesome thing about the USA being so big and so diverse is that you can find literally every type of cuisine there, both genuine and Americanized.",1
I know I’m late on this video but it’s absolutely criminal that Tennessee’s signature food wasn’t Nashville hot chicken considering how big it’s gotten.,0
"I'm from MD and can confirm our love of blue crabs, albeit most people I know would rather get a dozen steamed crabs and pick it themselves than get a crabcake just because picking crabs on the bay is a fun nostalgic activity.  I suppose crab cakes are usually preferred by tourists/people who want to stay clean/'civilized' meals haha. Seriously though, if you come to MD in the summer, go to Cantlers or Mike's crab house near the bay bridge, you wont be dissapointed",1
"As someone who grew up in New Jersey, I do love salt water taffy.  But sub sandwiches are the real iconic food from NJ.  The term ""submarine sandwich"" was coined in my hometown of Paterson by an Italian immigrant (thanks Wikipedia).  White House Subs in Atlantic City is one of the Jersey Shore's oldest sub shops, and of course the Jersey Mike's chain started from in Pt. Pleasant.   (Yes, your local deli probably makes a better sandwich. But JM's subs are at least far superior to Subway...)",1
I'm from Tennessee and frankly I'm quite disappointed y'all put Memphis Ribs over Nashville Hot Chicken. It's literally our staple food at this point considering how big Hot Chicken has gotten.,0
"As a West Virginian, I can confirm that pepperoni rolls are definitely what I was hoping to see 😂😂",1
"Wow, looks delicious! Guess I've to visit the states someday and this video will be my food tour guide. Really curious about those Chicago deep dish pizza.
Thanks from Indonesia 🇮🇩",1
"Our family moved to WA State from MN back in 1977 after nearly 10 years of living there.  I was only 2 years old.  But, grew up on tater tot casserole.  I was told it was one of the many recipes my mom took with her from MN.  And, so it explains it as a MN favorite food.",1
The Indian packaging for the fries is so satisfyingly efficient 😍,1
Nikhil had so much energy and was actually trying the food. Makes me want to travel to India just for the McD's food.,1
I love that basically everything has a vegetarian option in India. I’m kind of jealous.,1
"There are actually 2 extremely different McDonald’s menu’s in India I am from north India and over there most of the things are different from the menu shown in the video
Edit: the comments are actually telling me that there are two official distributors of McDonald’s in India and because of that the menu’s vary drastically which is pretty interesting actually and you guys could do a food wars season/spin off showing the regional differences between fast food chains in India itself",1
Nikhil is genuinely the best person to represent Indian food on global media. He knows his shit and how to accurately talk about India's various socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds.,1
"I love how Crystelle's part was a really serious and well presented history/geography lesson and they cut to Nikhil just be like ""iTs LiKe CrAcK"" lmfao",1
"kinda want to try indian mcdonalds after this, the masala potato wedges and the other sides look pretty good. and the paneer burgers would be fun to try.",1
"When a British person say it's the ""real deal"", it puts a little fear in our little indian heart. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 If you don't get this you need a history lesson",0
We need more of Nikhil on Food wars! The pre planned banter between Joe & Nikhil is damn funny 🤣,1
"Domino's India used to do twisties (twistie bread - they used to be these long braided dough with garlic butter and oregano seasoning brushed on top) long time back. They were an off menu item and the cheapest thing at Domino's. These teiesties were decentralized and being a broke college student, the twisties helped me a lot!",1
"I love how brutal the commentary is in this one. It's about time somebody puts Dominos in its place. I never really understood why people like them so much, but to each their own, I guess. It's just too bad they have no appreciation on what qualifies as food worth paying for.
 
BTW, Nikhil is so funny. I hope you have him on more often.",0
"I have wanted to visit India forever to experience authentic Indian food. It’s my favorite cuisine. But based on these videos, I’m almost tempted to go just to try the Indianized version of our crappy American fast food that I never eat in the states!  The curiosity is kind of killing me now. 😂",0
"Domino's India have deteriorated a lot over the years, their cheese burst doesn't burst anymore, stuffed garlic bread doesn't have cheese in it, and most importantly they don't use ""cheese"" anymore, it's all veg-oil based cheese substitute. Even their customer care and store staffs are not as good as before. I used to love Domino's before but now it's a nightmare.",0
"I've been living in India for almost 10 years now and prefer its pizzas much over the Western menu. I still remember my first year in India seeing a big domino's ad where they'd advertise two new pizzas with 'exotic' vegetables, the exotic vegetables being broccoli and zuccini. goes to show that exotic is very much a question of perspective ;)",1
"FYI,we also have Garlic Breadsticks, Stuffed Garlic Bread,Cheese Dominator(1 pound of mozzarella cheese melted on the pizza),5 cheese pizza(1 out of those 4 cheeses is a Ghost Pepper flavoured cheese),Paratha Pizza,Red Velvet Lava Cake and Butterscotch Mousse Cake,which is the most heavenly thing available on the whole Domino's menu but it's also true that these items are region specific that's why it is there in Kolkata,West Bengal but not in Bangalore",1
Loving this series. We get such boring Dominos pizzas here in the U.K.! The US pizzas looked good the Indian ones were interesting to see. I’d really like to try that apple dip and cinnamon sugar dough dessert from the US and the Indian chocolate lava cake looked yummy.,1
I’m so jealous of all those cool vegetarian options,0
"Nikhil is pretty funny. “Chicken maximus which sounds like a roman emperor, who is also a coward”….because he’s “chicken”",0

"When street food is more expensive than in a restaurant, you know you're in America.",0
"When it's difficult to want food, your videos genuinely help 👍",1
"you can literally buy almost everything in indonesia's street food with $100.


and of course, they taste AWESOME.",1
Everything is looking extremely delicious.I didn't know that we can these yummy things in 100$.That's just amazing 🤗,1
I Love Teriyaki McBurger,1
"I've only known George for 22 minutes, but he's too precious.",1
"When I lived in Japan about 17 years ago, MacDonald's had a burger called the McGrand. It had a creamy Dijon mustard sauce and a thick beef patty along with lettuce, tomatoes, and so on. It was so good that I still think about it occasionally. I was really disappointed when I moved back to Canada and it wasn't on the menu here.",1
"The Japanese packaging is cute. I’m also surprised Mcfloats aren’t a thing here. But the ice cream machines are always down, so maybe that’s a factor.",1
"I used to work as a manager at McDonald’s in Canada and I also travel to Japan often so when I do get McDonald’s in Japan, I often like to try something different there. 
It’s been a few years since I last went (partly due to Covid…), but I tried the locomoco burger and Hawaii blue drink and both were pretty good.
Oh and the teriyaki burgers are pretty good.",1
"Also, who thinks they should send me to Tokyo to try the exclusives irl? That’d be a good series, right???",1
"Funny to see a Teriakyi burger. I can't have tomatoes due to GERD and other issues, so I tried to find a replacement to sauce my burgers with. 
I tried Teriyaki on my homemade hamburger, and it was a great alternative. Funny enough, Japan's Mcdonalds does the same thing, lool. 
My at home one was fantastic, so I have no doubt they love it :)",1
The japanese sauce-packaging is awesome! This is probably the coolest thing i've ever seen at McDonald's,1
"A number of years ago McD did a limited ""Global Menu"" thing where they brought a few of their international exclusives to the US. I think the only thing they ever did before quitting it that I remember was a burger from Spain and a Stroopwafel McFlurry from the Netherlands. I don't remember trying the Spanish burger, it really wasn't anything that different. The Stroopwafel McFlurry was awesome tho, was sad to see it go. Anyway, I knew a little bit about the Japanese exclusive items, and was hopeful they'd continue it and do a run with a few of those here, the McTeriyaki Burger sounds awesome, and I'm surprised they haven't tried the McFloats here. Ice cream floats are a classic dessert in the US and it would be so easy. A Dr Pepper McFloat would be really good for US taste. I'm also kind of upset they ditched the Snack Wraps, probably a US exclusive you could have showcased here had they still been around. They had 3 that I remember, Big Mac, a barbecue crispy chicken one, and I think a bacon ranch one (?) wrapped in the same sized tortilla as the breakfast burrito. I think you got 2 per order, and They were a perfectly sized fast hot snack if that's what one was hungry for on the go.",1
Deadass all this looks 10x better than my school food,1
"""Then they mix it all together!""
God she was too happy about that haha.
I give points to Celine for being so grateful
Celine is so precious <3",1
"celine is so adorable, the parents did well raising her",1
"Nicholas is so cute.  ""If I went to prison I wanna go here!""  haha he's so innocent.",1
"Celine is so grateful and cute, she wasn’t complaining about the food and is pretty smart",1
I’m so proud of Celine parents. They raised her right.,1
"""do you ever eat with your hands?""
""Never""
Indians, pakistanies,Sri lankans or any desi pal: pathetic.",0
"Well, i grew up sleeping on bed lined with strawmat, eating on the ground ( culture thing), eating bugs because we didn’t get meat that often. And my generation was consider the lucky one because we got much more than previous ones. These foods look just fine for me, good variety.",1
I love how at the end of the United Arab Emirates food clip it just shows Celine eating the food with her hands like its no problem at all. Shes so precious-,1
Pls God i want a daughter just like Celine 🥺♥️ she’s adorable,1
This Indian dude is reviving this series for me. He’s hilarious,1
"Nikhil is a perfect addition to the Food Wars Cinematic Universe. Dude is just funny AF and super likable. Perfect compliment to Joe, who is also awesome.",1
"I had a professor from India and every time the department would order catering he would complain about the vegetarian option with good reason, it looked nowhere near as good as the vegetarian option in India.",0
"Food insider hit the jackpot with Nikhil as the host for Indian food. He does a really good job. I have one request and that is that you don't waste food by throwing it out after taking just one bite and instead cut off a piece from where you took the bite and offer it to someone who doesn't have food, it'll make that person's day and you wouldn't lose a thing.",1
"I remember getting in line for a subway at Delhi int airport. there was a line of say 6 people of which, 4 were non-indians. I was getting late and the line seemed huge. I was also wondering why so many foreigners were eating vegetarian, then one of them got in the front and the cashier told him that the non-veg line was on the other side and then they looked up and spotted that they were standing in the vegetarian line. The entire queue moved and I got my sub in time for my flight. Fun times!",1
"6:31 Chana is a smaller variety of chickpea, whereas dal/daal is called lentils in English. That aside, great video, and I really love Nikhil's sense of humour and style of presentation!",1
Nikhil is crushing this series - love him!,1
"Josh, you just recreated the medieval concept of a bagged lunch where you can eat the bag. Well done, let the Italians scream. I'd be all right with getting all my fast food in a Neapolitan style pie.",1
"This is a very good idea, imagine getting like a calzone stuffed with grilled chicken an Alfredo sauce, possibly a garlic butter brushed on top of the calzone 😋

I’m going to go make one rn",1
"I gave my 19 year old son the Joshua Weismann cookbook for “Easter”. (I’m a mom of grown males, I use any excuse to gift my kids things.) He sends me recipes so I can shop them before he comes out to my house. He didn’t really cook before crackin’ your book. He then brings the cookbook with him so we can cook meals together...something his older brother and I have done since he was four. It’s nice. 🌈🌈🦋🦋 
We will be doing some similar combos, once he watches this video...guaranteed! ♥️",1
Watching your videos makes me want to cook but I think I’ll just heat up some hot dogs,1
I've done a thanksgiving calzone before with leftovers. It was bomb af ngl.,1
"Hey Josh, I have been making a lot of your recipes recently it has been a blast! This last weekend my family and I decided to fire up the wood-fired pizza oven and make pizzas. I finally was able to get over there the night before and made dough from scratch. My GOD what a difference! Additionally, I used your burger sauce recipe as the base for a BORGER ZA. Dough. In-n-out sauce. Mozzarella. Parmasian. Ground Beef. Pickles. Onions. it was sent from god... thank you papa",1
"One time I had leftover BBQ pulled pork and leftover fettuccine in the fridge. I mixed them together and baked it in the oven until crispy. I know Italians and Texans were collectively losing their minds, but it tasted freaking amazing, so who cares? 🤷🏻‍♂️",1
"I've hated Calzone until the day I made it by myself at home. Every time I tried Calzone in a fast food restaurant, the filling was like boiled inside and just blah, I don't like it this way. Stopped ordering, started cooking it ;)",0
"""I'd never make my own mozzarella.  Too much responsibility.""

Desi is a level 3 human being.",0
Want to see more of Desi for sure! He’s relatable AF. “They got a hundred different types of sauce at the store. Why’d I make my own?” 😂,1
The Level 1 chef's commentary is pure gold!! 😂😂😂,1
The bounce back between Level 1 and 3 were great. Love to see those two more.,1
"Desi is delightful. ""I'm not gonna make homemade sauce, it's already in the store."" That's a man who works for a living.",1
"Desi is hilarious!  We need more of him.  ""With a deep fryer that oil gets on you, you gotta go to the hospital, it's dangerous"" #facts",0
Love all three. I want to try and prepare level three’s recipe but pair it with Beth’s sauce. Level one was the backbone of this video lol. His lack of time spent making the food was made up with his commentary lol. He was so relatable for the everyday person.,1
"The Pizza Planet Pizza being awful is just Disney sticking to the bit, since in universe it's basically Chuck E Cheese",0

Mabuhay ang Pilipinas! 🇵🇭",1
Never knew Filipino foods are so mouthwatering. Love from India,1
"I simply love how this team is always revisiting countries they already done in the past 👌🏼 and this ep is a vnoice surprise.
Pancit Palabok is my #1 fav noodle dish and what was shown here is close enough (Maynila’s take to palabok) to what that humble and timeless dish is all about since most dishes including this one has numerous iterations spanning not just country wide but on a global scale now days.
Keep it up y’all!",1
"I love Sonny's enthusiasm to eat unfamiliar foods. He didn't show any grimace or fear of eating. By the way, we don't eat some of these foods everyday except for palabok, lomi and pares. Some foods are normally eaten during feasts and parties to enjoy with other people.
I love how Mr. Chui guides Sonny on Filipino dishes! More power to your show!!! ❤❤❤❤❤",1
"Welcome back to the Philippines Sonny! Been a fan for many years and your videos is educational for me. I’ve learned a lot of cultures, authentic  food and the country’s people, because of you and your team! Thank you.",1
This is not just a food review channel....This is a cultural documentary that makes me appreciate our planet and I will support this channel till I'm an old woman.  👍🥰🥰,1
"Thank you so much for featuring the Philippine cuisine. I miss home  🇵🇭 , due to pandemic it’s been 3 years since i last visited my native country. Watching this made me homesick and oh my i love the foood especially the pares!",1
Sunny is really trying out the food of the world .. the ones that people are afraid to try .. yet sunny shows how people eat around the world and still live !!! Best food program ever .. I think I have seen literally every single video,1
"Filipino food is really sinful. Absolutely hearty, filling, and delicious.",1
"I love this collab! Congrats, Paps for being a part of this. Watching this makes me quite nostalgic on my student day in Manila because of the pares and the palabok",1
We had a blast shooting this series! What KFC exclusive do you want the most?,1
The India exclusive Krushers that were discontinued just a few months back were really delicious. They should bring that stuff back.,1
Glad that you included India in this series. During the lockdown my wife and I used to enjoy a KFC drive through a bit too often in the UK. Love from UK. 🇬🇧,1
I love how Nikhil is just being the best when it comes to explaining vegetarianism in India.....Like we don't need a veg biriyani....who even invented them..,1
"As someone who is following channels like BuzzFeed, tasty, food insider and many more channels who review food of India vs other countries, since 2017, I'll have to agree that i GENUINELY enjoyed this video. The editing, the humour, the variety, everything is just so indulging and fun to watch. Rather than your average countless food comparison videos which feel like they're all the same, this was refreshing to watch. Kudos! Looking forward to more of this content!!!",1
Welcome Nikhil! Can’t wait to learn more from you about all that delicious Indian fast food 😍,1
"You should check out Kenya's KFC,🇰🇪🇰🇪🔥 its wild.😂😂 We have a bucket with 9,12,15,18 and 21pcs, chicken wraps called twisters, my fav is the spicy rice bowl, hash brown burgers, Nyama nyama burgers which is a burger without buns(buns are chicken pieces instead). Chicken nuggets, krushers which is a milkshake with crushed cookies I like mine with oreos, Box master and crunch master which is like a shawarma and lastly KFC chicken salad....I almost forgot the double crusher burger with 2 pieces of chicken 😋😋😋😋. I'm now hungry 😅",1
I love this Nikhil guy. More of him please.😂,1
Yes! Dinner and dancing at Lotte Mart! This is the kind of episode I’ve been missing. Less gold leaf on caviar; more 7-11 and asian grocery stores!!,1
Watching Strictly Dumpling while eating my dinner is the most luxurious part of my day. Honestly feels like I’m eating with Mikey!,1
Having dinner and watching Mikey after a busy college day. I was just wondering why do I like these asian groceries stores videos so much! It's amazing the variety of pre made meals and frozen food they have! Everything look so good and Mikey said some of them are like eating from a restaurant. Impressive really!,1
"You are making me want to go to South Korea more, now, Mike! If even supermarket food is that good over there, how can I resist?",1
"""That's like eating out of a restaurant"" that's because restaurants freeze their foods like their ""fresh"" pasta too haha It's good to see a video that's more down to earth than the constant expensive places",1
Ive ALWAYS wanted to try this in Asia but havent gotten the chance to since i started doing this after the pandemic… but next chance I get I’m going for sure and doing a whole day there!! ❤️ thanks for even more inspiration Mike!!! You’re the best 🙌🏼,1
They all looked great and delicious.  I love dim sum and cooked some up today.  Some of the dumplings that I never have had were the soup dumplings.  Omg….they are absolutely awesome and delicious.  Cheers Mikey.  Another great video,1
"I found those churro chips in a local H Mart, and they are seriously addicting. Had to stop myself before eating the whole bag right after opening it.",1
The Korean Orion New Four Layers Turtle Chip Corn Soup Flavor and the chocolate churro flavor are simply the best! So glad it was showcased here for more people to know about how good it is!,1
I LOVE these types of videos! All that pre made and frozen food looks and I can only imagine how good it is! Thank you Mike!,1
I love how he doesn’t talk or make unnecessary faces...he just eats....,1
i like when asmr channels never include the cooking and straight to the eating but this channel is still always good,1
This guy is by far the absolute best mukbanger I've ever listened to ever.,1
I love that this guy always smiles and he enjoys what he is doing,1
It looks like Zach is living his best life and is happy when eat I have. So relatable 😩,1
All that food looks delicious ❤,1
First video I'm seeing and I would love to eat what he cooks already. 🤣 looks good.,1
Watching him cook is so satisfying.,1
"As a fellow immigrant to Korea who's now living in Vietnam, I have to agree with these judgments, especially how Lotteria chefs took a quick look at a burger and tried to recreate it off sight alone. The only thing I'd add is that the mozzarella sticks at Lotteria are the best I've had from any restaurant over here.",1
"Lol omfg, all this time I also thought Lotteria was Korean .......my bad. ^-^""",0

Man you put on the funniest food show on YouTube.  Love your content.,1
"Just wanna tell you guys keep going. Your show is entertaining, educating and fun to watch. You guys are living my dream. Props and rock on",1
You should try the “Big Tasty” from McDonald’s in the UK when you get a chance and if it’s available. Honestly it’s heaven. And the Chicken Legend is exclusive to the UK :),1
This is not just a food review channel. This is a cultural documentary that makes me appreciate our planet and I will support this channel till I'm an old woman.  🥰🥰🥰👍,1

"Mark, you found the right guy to bring you around. KF Seetoh is a legend in Singapore!",1
Yummy street food! I like those foods. 😍😋,1
"For those who don't know, KF Seetoh is a legendary street food critic in Singapore. He has really shine light on the traditional cooking methods and food culture, and guided the likes of Anthony Bourdain etc through his long career. I also personally respect that he does not put on airs or care about visuals the way other Singaporean food influencers do. He really cares 100% about the food.

Edited for grammar",1
Incredible job on that video! He is an icon to local food and has been pushing hard to promote the industry. I think you found the right man to introduce Singapore hawker food. I saved almost 90% on my flights using Mighty ✋🏻 Travels 🤝🏻 Premium.,1
"This gentleman, Seetoh made this video a DELIGHT.  Usually I watch everything you do expecting your take on certain foods. This man had amazing knowledge of EXPRESSLY Singaporian dishes....and it was extraordinary.  Thank You!",1
Love the fact that he's able to give us the history behind all the Singapore favorites. He was also a friend of Anthony Bourdain if you Bourdain fans may recall.,1
Such a joy to watch KF Seetoh. His passion for the local food scene. The way he celebrates the hawkers and food stall owners. Couldn't stop smiling the entire video. 29:48 was touching. Love the guy❤️❤️,1
"Glad that Mark chose to work with SeeToh, someone who has lived the 70s/80s, someone who has tasted and knows how authentic Singapore Street/Hawker Food in the 70s/80s were like, and how they were authentically prepared and the ingredients originally used in that era.......things that young people wouldn't know.",1
"As a Singaporean I'm so glad to see KF Seetoh introduce all the food in less well-known (not the chinatown complex, hong lim or golden mile) hawker centres that's locally loved!",1
i love how uncle seetoh just goes in the stalls like nobody's business because he's a living legend xD,1
Thank you very much for giving me this precious opportunity. I’m really honored to work with you amazing food war’s team. Arigatou gozaimasu!! And I’m looking forward to watching new food wars US vs India episodes!!,1
"George is just living his best life in this episode lol

Joe looks like he’s grounded while all his friends are out playing 😂😂😂",1
"So apparently the Japanese 7-Eleven's are like mini to-go restaurants, while the ones in the US serve packaged processed food, or reheated frozen processed garbage. It's almost an insult to call them the same store, how do we let them get away with this crap here?",0
"There's no comparison between U.S 7 Elevens and the 7-11 in Asia. Dramatic difference on quality of food and service. For ppl who live in the U.S and want to experience the Asia 7-11s, go to Hawaii. 7-11s are run by different companies in Asia which explains the significant difference. As an American, I barely go to 7-11 except if I need a drink. Food is mostly unedible unless ur drunk, high or don't care",0
It seems in this series that George enjoys what he eats WAY more than Joe does. <3,1
"I’m upset that Japan’s 7-11 has actual proper food where we have nothing but junk food. Anyways, I’m excited that you guys are branching out to India!",1
"Me, as a European, am always so surprised about the drink sizes in the US. How can the smallest soda be 651ML!! That would in the Netherlands be enough for the entire family!! (I mean in Japan they have 1l and 1.5 liter packages but they are clearly to pour in glasses and share, they aren't portion sized...",0
The Japanese chocolate doughnut looks much better than the one you’d get in America or here in the UK,1
"George is always saying how “yummy” everything was, so when he said “it tastes like S#%T!”. I almost fell off my chair! LMFAO 👌😂😂",1
"Who will go here to enjoy the food and claim the FREE DRINK?

Thanks for watching! Please also follow my Youtube channel to see great food pictures:

Never try Brazilian Food Before It looks yummy 😋,1
"I’ve never eaten Brazilian food before, that place looks legit 😍 the food looks fabulous",1
I already went to eat in this restaurant !!  Spectacular food and very delicious dessert.  I recommend !!!!,1
Wow!! The dessert was the best I have ever tasted in my life!  very good!  perfect ❤️ I loved it 🫶🏻😋,1
Oh my...😱 It is incredible !that is street food ..looks so yummy!😋🥰👍,1
"Everything looked INSANELY DELICIOUS!  Give me some!!!

Safe Journey!

CHOLULA!!!",1
"My wife and I eat the candy every Sunday, I highly recommend it.  It is wonderful !",1
It’s awesome to know there is a Brazilian street food as I love Brazilian Bbq.,1
"I can't explain exactly WHY this has become one of my favourite formats on the show, but it really has. I can never get enough of these",1
Mooshelle was really sucking it in for that fancy pants dance with chase.,0
"I started thinking that Moochelle looked like Chase this episode, then Rhett said Chase isn't Moochelle, and then Chase and Moochelle danced together. So I'm glad we put that to rest so efficiently and definitively.",1
That therapist is a true professional. To be able to hold it together with someone intentionally being like Randy and treating it like any other session is admirable,1
I am interested to see this series done by adding a mythical kitchen version into the mix,1
At this point we need an episode of what Link eats in a week… because I’m convinced he doesn’t eat anything with flavor or seasonings…. like a toddler…,0
"I was really hoping for my favorite app, potato skins. But maybe a whole potato based episode would be good. Potato skins, poutine, mashed potatoes, etc...",1
"Huge thank you to Ali for making this trip possible!

 Pakistan is a wonderful country and Pakistanis are great people. Love from Azerbaijan to our brothers ❤,1
"I became teary when they all gathered to eat, the smile,  joy on their faces, the sight of the food and the beautiful landscape all gave me goosebumps 🥺... I love food and beautiful people 😌",1
"This ain't a YouTube video, this is a wholeass documentary! Kudos to Sonny, Ali, the community they visited here, and the whole team behind the cameras💙💙",1
"As a Hunzai, I enjoyed every second of this video and I can't put my gratitude in words because I'm short of them. We love you sonny and all of these kind commenters.",1
"I love Sonny, but his editors are on a whole another level. The way the music, footages and everything comes together is just an amazing symphony of perfection!",1
"Pakistan looks like a such a beautiful place, would love to go there one day and experience it for myself.",1
"Thoroughly enjoying these videos of northern Pakistan as a Tibetan. It's incredible to see people from a similar landscape, background, and region, it's unfortunate I cannot visit my motherland Tibet, but I am vicariously living through your videos. Interesting fact, yak is the national animal of the Tibet. Keep the videos coming!",1
"Damn!! I'm Pakistani and I've been to Pakistan, not the Northern part though. This series has got me excited for when I travel there next time. Thank you for being so respectful Sonny, you've got a subscriber for life. <3 :D I love our culture, food, dresses, and our land. The way you and your team portrayed it is beautiful.",1
That’s amazing way of cooking!!! Cheers from IRELAND 🇮🇪,1
Whack that like button and I won’t fire manny today!,0
it’s so heart warming to see nick bring small time cooks like gordon to big time cooking,1
"Oh damn, I never realized Hell’s Kitchen is his actual restaurant. No wonder he gets so pissed when people absolutely destroy expensive food, that’s his baby",0
"As a uk citizen for 13 or 14 years, the curry sauce with the fish and chips is definitely traditional, my entire family loves it",1
"It's really good to see Nick helping out small chefs like Gordon Ramsey. The community appreciates it, Nick!",1
Thank you for supporting small businesses in these hard times you rock!,1
"Can we respect that Nick constantly shows himself eating Crab and Lobster Despite being Allergic to Shellfish, What a goat",0
The mashup of different pop all mixed together is called “swamp water.” Long time ago it was specifically Coke and orange pop but has transformed to refer to basically a mix of different pops of random assortment. It actually works well and is a go to for when I want something fun and youthful.,1
"Hey Mark, I really love all of your videos but this whole Spain series is definitely your greatest work as of today in my opinion. I actually built my holiday around some of the spots you visited during this trip. Keep up the great work. You really inspire a lot of people. Cheers✌",1
"Mark, you are the reason I will be putting Spain as a place to visit and eat at after this amazing food tour you have done this far. Every place you have showed us on your tour looks just absolutely amazing and stunning. The ambiance and the energy of these chefs is just outstanding. Also the quality of the ingredients and the recipes they have shared with you is just mouth watering. Spain is now on my bucket list thank you for showing your experience there. I am excited to see what is next!",1
"Gabriella: “San Sebastien is obsessed with raw ingredients and how they prepare them”, spot on! Food seems so simple when you look at it that way...but so few do.
Gabriella has been another perfect foil on your Spanish tour - these outstanding people you've worked with across Spain have taken everything to a genuinely jaw-dropping level. I love the format – working with people who are as passionate about food as you – and they simply take you to their favourite food spots - genius. I'm totally loving Merrihue being with you now...I'll feel rather sad the next time he's not by your side in a video! Loving your work, Mark.",1
"What I Love about Italy & Spain is the simplicity of preparing their food, allowing the natural taste of the food to shine through. In America we overcook, over prepare our food! The freshness of this food makes you feel like you never had true prepared food. Mark, this is what sharing food is really about! In your own words ""Wow!!! Can't help but to appreciate you & your show!",1
"Hands down Gabriella is one of, if not, the best tour guide in Mark's channel! She knows everything not just about the food but also the city of San Sebastian!",1
"Would love to travel the  🌎 and eat food like Mark. His love for food and the culture and stories behind the dishes, absolutely beautiful",1
"The genius of Mark’s videos is his ability to take deep dives into countries and truly convey his experience.  After seeing James Blick here I got hooked on his Vlog just like I how I found Joel’s and JLJ’s vlog.  Don’t change anything Mark.  Don’t go cable, network or public television…just keep doing what you do!",1
I'm so glad to see reviews on food from Spain. I never knew anything about Spanish food 'besides for western world Spanish food  like Mexico  to Brazil. I never was even interested i looking at Spain as a food destination and now its definitely on my food bucket list . So glad I've saved all the videos so if I ever go I can look book and plan a trip . Thanks Mark and Jeff.  And a big thanks to all of your guides on this trip. Im sure alot of these places would never be found easily.,1
El mejor sitio del mundo para comer😋😋😋😋😋👏👏👏👏👏🐙🦀🦐🦐🦑🦑😍😍😍😍😍😍I love San Sebastián,1
"I'm having a really tough time at the moment and seeing Marks passion, energy and enthusiasm has honestly made me smile so thank you very much ☺",1
i love you guys's videos keep up the awesome work,1
your videos are so cool and your doing an Great gob keep it up well done 👏,1
I love that the big chopsticks were drum sticks and the small ones were tooth picks.,1
I love this video and my daughter loves this video,1
I love it,1
Hi I love your videos keep up the good work,1
Nice I love 123 go troom troom every one🤩🤩🤩😘😘😘,1
I like the way that she eats.,1
I love 1 2 3 go they're so amazing and subscribe,1
I feel healthy watching him eat all that stuff.,1
I love how it took more time for him to eat popcorn than a whole entire chocolate cake,1
The thing that I love about him is he doesn’t waste food and his thumbnails are real,1
"My old time favorite video from Matt Stonie. Thank you, Matt Stonie, for the entertainment of competitive eating.",1
"matt stonie: *eats everything incredibly fast*
also matt stonie: *enjoys his icecream*",1
"This is a delicious idea!

Also, his GF watching him like “😏”

AlsoAlso Imagine hearing him eat with no music or background noise for an entire filming session ✌🏻💀",1
"This owner was one of the only one that I was on his side the whole time.  He was not egotistic, not in denial, accepts all the criticisms and opened to change.  He needs to be saved!",1
"I love how his son let his dad rage at him, knowing he needed to do it and being proud that he did it.",1
"I ate here as a kid before, during, and after the filming of this episode. My dad is vegan so we went here often. The food was always great and the son was who my family usually interacted with, he was always super nice. You could imagine my surprise when I got older and saw this episode lol. I never saw Gordon Ramsay but I saw the son and staff being interviewed one of the times my family went for breakfast. The potato pancake was my favorite on the menu! It's a shame the restaurant was sold and no longer exists.",1
This man is a very gentle soul. It's hard for him to get angry,1
"this is a really good episode, lots of great moments. the son getting excited about his dad standing up for himself, the owner secretly shaking the pan while handcuffed, the owner eating the plants straight from the pot... a fun time",1
"So wonderful to see that guy love his Dad so much that he wasn't even disturbed with his Dad yelling at him, recognised that it was apart of his Dad's growth as a manager, and got so excited by it happening!",1
The son of the owner was very well spoken and respectful. I really loved how he was honest with his dad but also showed a caring side as well.,1
I would literally eat here the owner was so respectful. You could tell he has a big heart and willing to do what he can to improve the restaurant. He's definitely not arrogant and takes criticism well.,1
"The owner is so down to earth, humble and nice. If this is my Boss I would literally work longer in that restaurant.",1
I respect everyone who were involved in this. Seriously the best piece that I've ever seen on YouTube. HATS OFF TO YOU ALL! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS! ❤,1
I love how Preston is for kids but has adult jokes in it,1
"Preston is type of guy who creates clickbait titles and clickbait thumbnails but the video ends up actually being what the title and thumbnail say, so extra awesome points to him",1
"for me milk actually makes it 100x spicier, even if i'm not eating something spicy! just regular pasta burns my throat with milk!",1
The egg blew my mind. We did some great research Preston.,1
The reason it feels spicier when you drink water is because the water makes the spice spread around your mouth,1
"ATTENTION FOOD WISHERS!!! SCAM ALERT!! I have no other account names on YouTube, and do not offer any prizes or special deals. Unless the message is from this account it's not me. Do not fall for scams by people using a similar name. Thank you!!",0
Chef John always coming through with the best stoner food.,1
"I have been coming back Chef John's recipes then and again for years. There's always great nuggets of advice (and reasons to chuckle) in these videos. Thank you once again, Chef!",1
"I’m allergic to sunflower seeds and most store-bought potato chips are cooked in sunflower oil, so this opens up my life to potato chips! Thank you, Chef John!",1
"Chef John - from beef wellington to potato chips in the microwave, the man does it all!",1
"I had to come back to say this works great! I used olive oil spray though and Lawry's season salt, but same result. Very crunchy. Only 6 minutes in my micro, so as Chef John said, watch them because everyone's micro is different.
Also, kudos to the parchment paper trick to cut it round. But I think I did one too many folds because I ended up with 2 parchment paper circles attached together.  😁",1
These look amazing ☺️. I hate the fact that store bought crisps (I'm watching from the UK) or chips are broken up into little pieces due to handling I guess. Thanks for sharing,1
Omg can we take a moment and say I am so impressed with how she takes care of her teeth while eating so much candy 😋,1
i love how she always wears the same themed hair makeup and clothes! i love it,1
🤤 *_THIS IS VERY RELAXING AND LOOKS TASTY_*  🤤,1
I love how she whispers it sounds like really cool and I love how she match the Candy!!!,1
she does asmr amazing <3,1
Candy packaging is always so fun! And I’m good! It’s 2:58 AM and I’m wide awake!,1
ay que gran ASMR es  el mejor ASMR de mi vida😍,1
"Let's just take a moment  to appreciate the time that hunni takes to do her 
Makeup and to find purple clothes",1
I really love these videos you make me relax and lay down in my bed lol,1
I mean the fact that I'm hungry and still decided to watch these and make myself even more hungry.,0
"Yes, I should be asleep right now.
Yes, I am starving.",0
Love this.. It really makes me hungry looking at those delicious dishes,1
I'm just upset because they don't tell me where the hell these places are.,0
Dios mio! Que deliciaaa! Es increíble todo lo que podemos lograr en la cocina. Se me hizo agua la boca,1
"Yes, I'm starving
Yes, I'm sleepy
Yes, it's my choice if I wanna sleep
But....
I'M FASTING DUDE!",0
"Incrível 😍, hummm parece delicioso 👏👏👏",1
An epic effort with all the donations to the food bank. True class act Erik.,1
I just love watching Erik eat an entire buffet while I eat my regular ass lunch🤣,1
"Erik, you're a certified nut, but I absolutely love it. The surprise at the end absolutely warmed my heart! You are such an incredible person, keep spreading the love ❤️",1
Pringle’s and caviar! 🤣🤣🤣. Do love the donation to the food bank! That’s awesome and I know you helped a lot of people with your generosity!!,1
Let’s appreciate the fact Erik goes so above and beyond with videos like this. Keep up the amazing content 💪🏻,1
The quality of your videos has always been good but lately they've been next level. Plus you're showing your sense of humor recently too - just an all around good time,1
"Good for you! Class act human being right here! Challenge or no Challenge, donating to food banks, especially how much you did, is AWESOME",1
The editing and performance in this video is THROUGH THE ROOF!! Absolutely insane!!,1
honestly your pink sauce looks good.... can i buy a bottle?,1
"The gov’t must order her to stop the sale of this immediately, especially if it’s that perishable and not shipped properly.",0
"The fact that she doesn't even know what FDA stands for, along with how it's all packaged (the list could go on) shows that this is obviously not safe",0
"Me and my parents literally have a recipe for a sauce that looks like a pale version of the Pink Sauce. We've been using it mainly for french fries and I love it. So thanks, I don't need to pay for this, I can make it on my own :) And also it has probably less calories in it",1
I'm honestly quite confused why she hasn't been taken to court yet. She has a nutrition facts that make NO SENSE,0
It’s always absolutely delightful (or even delicious) to see scammers get publicly called out,1

"As a Tanzanian from the Chagga tribe myself, I am incredibly grateful for your generosity and how respectful you are of everyone's culture. 
Keep doing what you do ;)",1
"I can definitely see how this region's heritage and lifestyle has influenced the Caribbean, especially Jamaica... I really enjoyed this episode. ❤",1
The host is absolutely so kind. Loved the Hospitality they showed to our Sonny and Team ! ❤️,1
"The producers are so good at finding people from a location who are excellent cultural ambassadors for their country, city, village, or tribe.  Sonny has a knack for cross-cultural communication, but the individuals and families that host him at their tables are remarkable people.",1
As a Chagga that’s living abroad at the moment…you best believe I almost cried when I saw Mbege (I miss it) and him eating Machalari…It’s literally my favorite dish from home. I watch your videos and I was definitely happy to see this particular video from you Sonny👍🏾🇹🇿,1

We got to give credit to the co-host! She’s very enthusiastic and fun to watch! Her punchlines were not bad at all! Kudos!,1
"This is so awesome, in Puerto rico we call a pig roast over a fire lechon, the legs of animals Pata and fried skins chicharon too. 😍 I've gotta visit the Philippines at least ones I'd feel right at home.",1
I like her as a co host. Please have Aling  on more episodes because I enjoy her self confidence and she's up to trying the questionable gleck you sometimes eat without too many qualms about it.,1
"Philipino cuisine is criminally under-rated! I’m Mexican American from So. California and believe it or not, I went my first 23 years of my life never having had the pleasure of trying it outside of a few random delicious desserts from my aunt’s filipina coworkers. Wasn’t until I started dating a half Filipina half white girl I first got to try it at a legit restaurant. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING! My family would always tease me for putting vinegar and salt on pretty much anything and when I realized spicy vinegar was a normal everyday table condiment I felt like I found my long lost relatives haha! That alone would have been enough for me but then dessert absolutely sealed the deal… HALO-HALO!… Are you kidding me filipinos!? That is crack cocaine in dessert form! And everything else! All of the sweet sticky rice flour balls filled with coconut and ube purple sweet yam and taro! 

I love my Mexican food and while I wouldn’t ever trade it for anything, filipino food seriously gives it a run for its money in my opinion.",1
Nice to see you back in the Philippines enjoying & trying Filipino dishes Sonny! ❤️😋❤️😋❤️,1
"sonny, you should try the ""adobo version"" of cooked frogs with tons of red, small chili and garlic prepared by our very own locals. it's delicious!",1
"I love that philipibes reminds me of my coubtry mexico, the crickets here in mexico are prepared deliciously as well",1
"This man is THE MAN! he has more knowledge about Filipino food than my fellow Filipino/a who's in this video.

Edit: wala naman po ako sinabing pangit kay ate gurl pinuri ko lang yung vlogger haha.",1
The side dish is called smoked shotgun shells. It's been super popular for the last couple of years on a lot of BBQ channels and at BBQ competitions.,1
"Guga needs to have December simply be a ""Best of"" month where he spends an entire month redoing some of his easier best experiments and comparing what the best experiments of the year were.

I WOULD LOVE THAT",1
judging by angel and leo's reactions it seems like guga's cooking just gets better and better every video!,1
"That movie theater butter flavor is thanks to something called “butter salt” (brand name Flavicol).  The compounds that give butter it’s buttery taste can be made artificially (or extracted from actual butter), then mixed with salt as a powder.  This is then mixed with oil, and that’s what movie theaters use.  You should dry age with the pure Flavicol powder — I bet that’d be incredible",1
"Has anyone mentioned that this BBQ sauce looks fantastic? 
Will you tell us how you made it Guga?",1
Hey guga we know that dry brining steak is actually good so what if try dry aged steak using garlic powder and black pepper and let's see if it will work and will taste much better ☺️,1
"Popcorn oil is amazing. 

I used to work at a movie theater and we’d pop the kernels by adding one pump of oil into the hopper. One day I added a second pump of oil and the popcorn was amazing. Perfect golden color, savory, delicious. People complimented how good the popcorn was. I became the guy responsible for making all the popcorn. One day I showed a co-worker my secret and he thought, “if 2 pumps of oil is better than 1, then 6 must be amazing!” We received so many complaints over his oily popcorn. Had to throw the whole batch out in giant garbage bags. The lesson: a little oil goes a long way, don’t overdo it with that stuff 😆",1
"The juxtaposition between Angel and Leo's reactions is hilarious.
Leo: The juices themselves you get from the steak are creamier, it's a little bit more savory, it's a little bit rich, whatever you did to it enhanced the flavors of the steak and made it an overall better experience, I love this.
Angel: The second one had a *urgh* , you know like it's like *Urgh* , it's like *URGH* , you know it's like *UURRGH*",1
"A thought hit me recently- we need a ""Guga Meatloaf""- I can just imagine how amazing that would be. Whether with Waygu or regular beef I think it would be an awesome experiment.",1
Does anyone else just love the sound of the food as she sets it down?,1
Love this so much! 🧡🧡🧡Look so delicious! 🍗🧀🍝,1
"Que rico todo me encanta

"In WW2, when the Americans liberated the concentration camp ""Saint-Cyprien"", located in France. The American troops wanted to feed the newly freed Camp Prisoners because they have been starving. 

Without knowing what would happen if they would feed them heavy food, literally seconds after liberating them. The soldiers, thinking it was the right thing, started giving the Prisoners Apples, Sandwiches, and even Chocolates. 
Leading to a lot of Prisoners dying.

After that incident, the Science team gave out an order to not feed the prisoners in the camps and to let the Medical Staff feed them first.
It was mostly a slow input of light soup.",0
The fact that Jimmy talked about refeeding syndrome and had a bunch of medical experts on standby really shows the precautions he takes behind the scenes. He's really serious about doing these challenges and definitely should be taken inspiration for a lot of people.,1
There’s a story on YouTube about a crew of Japanese sailors who shipwrecked on an island and went a few weeks without food. They were eventually rescued by an American ship and the captain was extremely strict with what the starving crew ate. Making sure they only ate small amounts of soup. Ship captains in the 1800’s clearly knew how to deal with starvation. And it goes to show how easily knowledge can be lost.,0
"One could say, Gordan's food is to die for.",0
"My grandmother told me this story: We're from the Philippines, and during the end of WWII during and at the exit of the Japanese occupation, the US military started to air drop supplies to the civilians including food. One of my grandmother's neighbors, a young boy, picked up a can of corned beef and ate it straight from opening the box of supplies. He dropped dead moments after. At the time my grandmother thought he died from choking to death, but later realized it must have been refeeding syndrome.",0
I just feel the need to say as someone diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa I appreciate you Mat for bringing light to the dangers and science of them,1
"13:15 just a quick correction there. Jimmy did do it for the content, but he stated in the comments it was also because he has Crohns disease, which means he has a nasty amount of gut inflammation. He wanted to know if fasting would help with the inflammation.",0
"I was in a pretty bad accident when I was younger, spent about 3 weeks in ICU hooked up to a nutrients IV and could only drink water with a straw while stuck in bed. I still remember the first time I tried to eat solid food after that. It was a little microwave Kraft Dinner cup. I took one bite and immediately was hit with a wave of nausea to the point and nearly vomited right there in my hospital bed. I haven't really been able to eat plain KD since then :/",0
"This is probably my favourite food theory video to date. This information could save lives of people who fast, whether voluntarily or not. As someone who has unfortunately been in a position of not being able to acquire food, I really appreciate this information. There had been times in which I went a few days without food, only to try and stuff myself. I only ever felt sick, and knowing it's my body's natural response is a huge perspective change.",1

I love about BBQ in Baltimore in #DDD line up! 🥩🍖🍗🥓 Smoking ain't it?! 🔥🐷,1
I want to see some Delicious Brisket 😋,1
"Chef, very nice bbq recipe, although I like to eat my slaw & Pickles on the side, nice food truck/trailer also",1
Hopefully you did get to try some crab cakes too though 😆,1

Pakistan food surely looks delicious.

With love from Northeast India 🤍🇮🇳",1
"Looks great!  The bakery where I work makes blueberry cornmeal muffins - for dairy we use sour cream rather than milk/buttermilk and we also add a little lemon zest and vanilla, but otherwise very similar!  Someone has maybe already commented this, but we also toss the blueberries with one reserved cup (for a recipe of this size probably a couple teaspoons or a tablespoon would be perfect) of the dry ingredients before mixing them in to keep them from sinking.  Blueberries and cornmeal make a great combo!",1
"I’m upset about other things in my life, and I’m still confident that I would love these (and not complain about blueberry placement)",1
"Perfect timing! We have two blueberry bushes that give us about 2 gallons of blueberries every summer, tomorrow the picking begins and will continue for at least two weeks, can't wait to try this recipe!",1
This looks so delicious! Can't wait to try it!,1
I've heard a good way to keep berries from sinking is to coat lightly in flour before adding them into the batter.,1
"I call the sweet style cornbread ""breakfast cornbread"" cause when it's paired with a glass of milk or cup of coffee it makes a great breakfast. I'm gonna try adding blueberries to my next batch.",1
"Looks delicious!  I've got a recipe for strawberry cornmeal cake, and I add the strawberries last and gently swirl them into the batter that's already in the pan to keep them suspended in-cake.  That being said, I also love cobbler so I don't have a problem with Blue Bottom cornbread either!",1
"I'm really impressed by how clean your oven looks! And of course, your blueberry cornbread, which looks heavenly! Can't wait to try this recipe!",1
"When he said his family couldn't afford the drinks in a packet when he was a kid and now he's travelling all over the world and has everything he likes, I felt so good! You have come a long way Mikey! Cheers to you!!",1
Omg yesss another 7 eleven vid! These are my fave!!😍😍😍,1
"When Mike nods his head yes AND no at the same time, you know it’s good.",1
Living in the UK I’m always envious when I see these kind of convenience store videos! I would love that amount of choice in a store near me 😍,1
"I originally started watching your channel because of your 7 Eleven & Vending machine Japan episodes. SO happy to see more 7 Eleven content. I don’t know why, but they fascinate me.",1
Mike enjoying Korean convenience store food more than Disney USA…. Priceless.,1
"I always come to your channel when I'm having a bad anxiety ridden day. It helps me relax, and it's truly entertaining. Thank you ☺️",1
"This guy is so relaxing to watch ngl. Just hop into bed, turn this guy on, and drift off to sleep watchin this guy eat",1
I love how he pours the whole bottle and says “that’s enough”😂😂,1
"Those spicy pickles looked good, I might have to try that! 🥒🔥",1
I love how the spicy cereal guy poured the whole bottle of source then said that’s enough,1
i love how rami is mostly the honest one when it comes to no reaction,1
I love how the ramen noodles man is just getting everything in his eye,1
"My Mexican mom: serves me a plate of spicy food
Me: *takes a bite* THIS IS SPICY!
My mom : wdym? it’s not spicy!
Also my mom: does not react to the food",0
I like how the only thing spicy is what they make themselves 😭,1
6:50 couldn’t stop laughing 🤣,1

I love the fact that he's so respectful and willing to be open minded on others cultures 🥰💖✌,1
great video as always! you make 20 minutes seem like 5 minutes by being so entertaining and informative,1
It really rubs me the wrong way when people try and serve something they won’t even eat. No need to be sensational. Suny you always do such an amazing job dealing with all types of situations you find yourself in! Great video,1
"When my youngest sister was about a month or so away from having her first child, I told her that the hospital takes the placenta and will make something like spaghetti or lasagna and that's the first meal after her baby was born. She kinda freaked out when they brought her a bowl of spaghetti. I'm such a mean brother 🤣🤣🤣",0
"Nothing Sonny tries shocks me anymore lol. I mean, drinking raw blood and eating a fish alive! Great content as usual!",1
It's really interesting that you said that placenta's texture is very mushroom-like because there's a really good manga that featured evil babies that grew out their placentas into fake mushrooms so they could mind control the hospital staff by feeding them the placentashrooms. Makes you wonder if Junji Ito ate placenta before.,1
"In my hometown in Việt Nam when I was a child, we raised cows and we also ate placenta . It was not an everyday treat and in my opinion it is a delicious delicacy. So fascinating to see some Thai folks enjoy it as well.",1
"with the combination of animals, organs, countries, and styles of cooking i love how Sonny would never run out of content like this 😂",1
I love how you can put a literal 3 feet tall stick in a freezer at home,1
The watermelon jello looks so delicious 😋,1
I always love your videos since I was a kid,1
I love the videos keep it up,1
"I love those stuff you made, keep up the good work",1
Good job 👏,1
Your are very creative,1
I love this channel,1

"I really enjoy the episodes where Calvin appears, he's just the perfect complement for you Sonny, your chemistry just makes the videos really interesting, funny and enjoyable",1
"Been following your channel for the last 4 years and I think Calvin is probably your best co-host. He's funny, he knows how to make jokes and make fun of you. Let's keep him more on your show.",1
That lady's face when Sunny was about to sniff the fermented shrimp paste. so adorable,1
"I want more episodes with Calvin and Sonny - I can see the best food bromance forming already and the humour/vibe they created was really entertaining!
Loved it",1
You guys are the perfect duo... I absolutely love this show and Calvin is so awesome 🥰🥰🥰,1
"I had the pleasure of meeting Calvin in person while in Vietnam 2 weeks ago, he was eating and drinking with us and he’s definitely a down to earth person with a humorous personality. It would be awesome to meet Sonny one day too 😊",1
"I never thought I'd type this sentence, but as someone with a fear of snakes, I'd actually try the snake intestine noodle dish. This was really interesting! Thank you as always for the great content and Calvin is awesome!!",1
I just love how Sonny and Calvin are just having a casual food conversation after the snake went and did its business all over Sonny's shirt,1
"I love Calvin as a co-host, I don't think he's done an episode with Sonny without using the word ""gelatinous""",1
I love how the family eats together 🥰,1
The beef brisket with the hot noodles look delicious 😋,1
The food looks so delicious and it looks like the both of you are enjoying the meal. Thanks for another great video. 🥰,1
Очень аппетитно 🤤🤤👍,1
Who's watching hungry wanting the same thing ☝️I love king crab,1
"Sarap ng ulam ninyo mga idol magluto naman kayo ng bicol express na super anghang at pa shout out Gabion family from contod, gubat, sorsogon ♥️",1
Wow! Laki nman ng crab... Thank you nga pala sa pa shout out mga kahabhab...   Enjoy eating... God Bless po sa inyo....,1
Yan yung request ko na seafoods mukbang yummy,1
So nice how her husband is helping her finish the meal and always smiling:))),1
"i’m chronically ill and very frequently find it difficult to eat, watching eating asmr has worked wonders to help with nausea and motivate me to eat. thank you for all you do!!!!",1
I love that she won't push herself to finish the plate and stops when she is full :),1
Love how you can tell she’s grateful that she can eat these yummy meals (^>^),1
I love how organized and clean your food and house is :>,1
I love how she cooked! That looks really good!!:) I love how she just injoys it!!,1
Acho muito fofo quando ela está de boca cheia 😹❤️,1
"как же всё вкусно выглядит, браво.😍",1
"(Please turn on English subtitles!🙏)

진짜장과 돈마호크 돈까스 조합은 사랑입니다..😍
The combination of pork cutlet and jajangmyeon is the best food combination😍

Super yummy 🤤,1
Me alegra ver que la gente es feliz comiendo 👌,1
Is it me or is he living his best life right now with all that dam food 🤤,1
"I love this guy. He's given me so much inspiration for new stuff to cook and I really discovered a whole new adventure of flavours.

But I cannot deal with how he eats his chicken. Just doesn't give a fuck about the cartilage. Right into it.",1
Acho lindo ele preparando a comida 😍👏,1
Me encantaria probar tu comida 😋🥰 se ve devina,1
Todo es delicioso 😋,1
This sounds and looks so appetizinggggg!🤤,1
He’s so happy while eating because he can see us suffering in the other side of the screen,1
"I feel like Zach is just someone who really loves eating and decided to share his passion with the world. Also, I love the way he smiles at the camera while eating!",1
Such a nice guy. makes it so we dont have to suffer from messy set ups. and even let us have the first bite : D,1
I am starving while watching these literally on the brink of tears of how jealous I am but it's all worth it for his smile and quality ASMR I tell ya.,1
"This man took the time to stack all those fries
👏 Respect",1
The burgers looks good and all that crunchy fries absolutely delicious 😋 I’m actually craving for fries right now 🤪😎😎🤓🤓🤓,1
his food always looks so good,1
something that never fails to amaze me is how this man can eat as much and nikacado but still stay fit and stuff.,1
I Love that he uses his manners and eats with his mouth closed. Thank him and his Familia.,1
"The fact that he makes his own fried chicken, AND makes it look super satisfying while cooking is amazing. I can’t even make fried chicken let alone pour *flour* in a bowl nicely. 😭 💕",1
"It is astonishing how crispy he can make his food, he's such an inspiration.",1
"seneng banget bang zach cobain indomie lagi, emang indomie ga ada lawan, paling enak, apalagi kalau di makan sama telor... love from Indonesia 💗💗🙋🏻‍♀️",1
I love how much effort he puts into his videos😍 Zach has yet to disappoint🤩,1
"I rarely watch the cooking process, but I have to admit that it's really relaxing",1
Everytime we see him eating delicious food our mouth just starts watering 🤤,1
"As always, the cooking process looks so elegant. you're amazing, Zach! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤",1
Mee Goreng is always SUCH a vibe and is definitely one of my childhood faves. Another awesome video Zach. Keep going! <3,1
the way he cooks and prepares all his meals is so amazing and it looks so good on camera,1
"Today, I made fried food with Cheetos!
Would it be delicious to make food with snacks?
I thought it would be really bad, but there was a huge twist! 
It was so delicious and the color was so cool!
Especially, it was really delicious when I fried snacks on rice cakes!
It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside!
I want to eat again!
You should try making it, too!
Thank you for watching my video!

今日はチートスのお菓子で揚げ物料理を作ってみました！
お菓子で食べ物を作るなんて···。 非常にまずいようだったがとてつもない反転がありました! 
とてもおいしくて,  色もとてもきれいな食べ物でした!
特にお餅にお菓子をつけて揚げて食べたから本当に美味しかったです。
外側はさくさくで、内側はしっとり！
また食べたい！
皆さんも作ってみてください！
僕の映像を見てくださって、  ありがとうございます。

오늘은 치토스 과자로 튀김 요리를 만들어봤어요!
과자로 음식을 만든다니... 아주 맛이 없을 것 같았는데 엄청난 반전이 있었어요! 
너무 맛있고, 색감도 좋았어요!
특히나 전에 뽑아뒀던 가래떡에 튀긴게 신의 한수였는데,
겉은 바삭하고, 속은 촉촉한게 아주 별미였습니다
또 먹고싶다!
여러분도 만들어보세요!
제 영상 봐주셔서 감사합니다!",1
Algún día podré ir a Corea del Sur y comprar ASMR que humilde SIO Siempre alegrándonos el día ☺️,1
Me encanta todo lo que comes ...me gustaría algún día comer todo.lo que haces tú ...saludos desde Perú 😊😊😊,1
He smiles every time he eats he just knows that we’re watching him eat good food while we’re suffering,1
Ay dios para nosotros los mexicanos eso es el paraíso 🤤🤤🤤,1
I love how he does have sub titles in his vids so we can understand but he is the best asmr on the block to me,1
The food looks so delicious I’m literally watering 🤤🤤🤤❤️❤️❤️,1
I am amazed of how much she can eat. She actually helps me eat. Love the way she eat!!  And lipstick stays on. She is just awesome!  I haven’t seen this in a while. Glad I am back!n🥰🥰🥰🥰,1
*I love how happy she looks while shes eating its adorable*,1
I just love it how she eats clean and the sounds oh I’m hella hungry rn I wish I could grab the food through the screen!!!!😂❤,1
Korean: 설기가 항상 만드는 모습을 보여줘서 너무 좋아요!! English: I love how sulgi always shows her making it i love it!!,1
I only watch asmr when I'm hungry so I'm just torturing myself like that.,0
"i luv watching this video"" even though my stomach is full"" ,i luv the way she cooks and eat <3 i like korean food i wish i could eat it tooooooo",1
"Hello Tasha,Steph,Eli, Rhonda and viewers. I love when Rhonda is on. I know I'm going to enjoy the video as usual. Enjoy your meal and day.",1
The enchiladas look so good...Would Steph consider sharing her recipe? or a video showing how she made it?,1
Love when Rhonda comes to visit!! I want to see her more she’s hilarious 🤣🤣 this video had me cracking up in the break room on lunch lol love y’all!!,1
Tasha’s answers had me ROLLING 🤣🤣 “1985?” Son when I tell you that took me out 🤣,1
This was fun and the food looks great as usual. Good to see Rhonda again. Y’all should do a cook off and send the food to me as a judge lol. I love enchiladas!,1

My daughter made it through her first week away at college. They been parting and getting to know everyone. Blessings to Eli on his new journey.,1
"앜ㅋㅋㅋ설기네서 먹는 음식은 맛도 두배 재미는 세배😋🤣

The food you eat at Sulgi house is twice as delicious. And it's three times more fun😂😋",1
😋😋😋😍😍😍 uau deve ser que isso daí tá gostoso hein,1
Хочу тоже все это  скушать😃❤️,1
Me dá água na boca vocês tinham 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉,1
Eu espremetei e uma delícia 😋,1
Your way of cooking is sanitary compared to people - who in the name of doing mukbang - eating the octopus alive or biting the head of the octopus and enjoying the black ink coming out of it.. I really admire your way of cooking and how you're keeping it constant..,1
I love how satisfying her videos are without being obnoxious or gross. We love you and thank you for being so consistent and active with your fans! 💜,1
"me encanta la ternura,delicadesa y limpieza con la que hace sus videos🤩😊",1
I love how her food looks so good and she doesn't really make a mess on her mouth when eating and she is kind i love herasmr it's the best,1

IDC about this guy's health anymore. He's chosen his path but I hope the person reading this continues there weight loss/health journey! You got this fam!,1
"I was so insecure about myself because i thought i was getting “fat” for eating 2 sausages and one burger at a barbecue, and I remember this guy exists.",0
Honestly if this man does a weight-loss journey he will be an inspiration.,1
"Straight to the comment section. 

Keep it up everyone!! Hit your goals!! Be healthy!!!!",1
this honestly just makes me wanna drink water and have a salad 😀,1
"You are inspiring thousands to do the exact opposite. You're videos are saving lives. Unfortunately,  you may lose yours as a result.",0
"This is amazing, Ive been loving McDonald’s my whole life and its been a major vice/problem for me that has not only affected my health but also hurt relationships. Because of your bravery, and mutated physical appearance, I am proud to say McDonald’s is ruined for me and I puked in my mouth a little bit watching this.",1
He is a good inspiration for the people who have positive mindset like it's inspire us to continue living to taking care ofour physically and mental health💜💜💜,1
"I’ve commented on a previous video he put out around a year go that I was gonna get my life in check, lose some fat and get healthy, I can happily say I’m down 97 lbs I weighed in this morning at 209 lbs and honestly haven’t feel better in my life, thank you for the motivation I needed, I hope you find happiness in your life",1

His food makes me hungry but his smile makes my day!😁,1
That looks so good! Your one of the few mukbang YouTube's that actually finish your food! (for the most part),1
"It’s literally scary seeing how Candy can barely stand on her own and she’s still doing mukbangs. She has such a sweet personality, it hurts to see people destroy themselves like this",0
"Thank you niko i showed this to my 5 yearold coisin who said ""when I grow up im gonna only eat takis"" now hes scared of takis <3 I get to teach him about health from such a small age now love the videos bud.",1
This channel wants me to get more and more healthier every day,1
the food looks delicious I really want some but im not throwing my life away for that,1
It’s Actaully nice to see him smile ..,1
"Start making mukbangs eating a lot of fruit, vegetables, vegan recipe, small bit of meats and fish no carbs we would love to watch u eat a lot of that.",1
"If you ever feel bad about eating a bag a Takis in one day, then remember that this guys will eating FIVE in one sitting with noodles!!",0
"I actually like watching these two, because of them I am getting fitter and thinner every month and I am loving my diet result so far and they are like my motivation reason, I know it's odd but watching others go fatter I became skinny myself because it makes me want to be healthy looking. 😁",1
Watching this while working out so it can motivate me 💀,1
Love both Duggee and Bounce. But what is interesting is watching the difference between a puppy and an adult dog.  The adult dog has learned to take his time and appreciate the meal.  The puppy eats like it’s his last meal and taste is secondary. Love this father and son duo. Keep the videos coming.,1
"I love both Bounce and Duggee. So cute in their own ways. Like the other commenter mentioned here, the leader of the pack always eats first. Bounce is the leader. No wonder he was barking when he knew that Duggee was eating.",1
Bounce and Duggee are so much fun....Duggee is so cute and enjoys his food I love these videos,1
"duggee is getting super well trained! 😬

i love it when mr. bounce stops in the middle as if he freezes in time 😂 also when he looks to his dad as if saying ""yes, thats a delicious meat dad. i cant stop chewing. omoshiroi""",1
"These pups are living the good life, all this luxurious food 🤩❤️",1
Look how healthy n strong 💪🏽 🐕 they are raw meat 🥩 is good for dogs,1
Que lindos perros 😍😍😍😍😍🐶🐶🐶,1
Bounce is funny and duggy 🤣,1
Me dio risa cuando paso la cola del gato por la cámara 😆😆😆😆🐶😍,1
Muito bom dia com muita saúde que delícia sua refeição 😋🍛🍥🍲🥗🍝🥘🍜👍👍🇧🇷🇧🇷,1

Шикарно и красиво !!!👍👍👍,1
"Hey Fam ❤️I am a Nigerian ASMR mukbanger but I love Korean meals which is why I love Ami and all she brings here. I am going to try your recipe, thanks for sharing my beautiful sister. You are the best 👍",1
"Not only does he eat the food, he shows us how to make it! He is taking asmr serious and bringing it to the next level! Keep it up Zach",1
"At this point, Zach can fully rely on his wonderful cooking skills and YouTube channel and won’t have a single problem with his money. Top quality videos, Zach! Keep it up!",1
It is crazy to imagine how far your content has come! You’ve gotten insanely good at camera work!! I always rewatch videos to see the shots over again!,1
Zach smiles so happily while eating those delicious meals because he know the ones watching his video are dying of hunger.,1
"That truly is a cooking masterpiece.
Zach, you are such an expert, I wish I could meat and eat with you one day in my life!",1
"Definitely a Zach Mukbanger fan. Hooked from day one. Videos are amazing. Love the cooking sessions, which I've definitely learned a lot. Why eat out? These videos are more than enough. An artist at what he does. Good always looks amazing. No words to describe his talent. Great job!",1
É tão satisfatório ver ele cozinhando 🥰🇧🇷,1
"Zach has changed so much since he first started. He  used to be  not well known but now that he has millions of fans, he is popular and  his videos have improved  soo much. Congrats Zach 🙂",1
"like always, we can rely on Zach to make brilliant quality videos. Top class cooking 💚",1
Wow yummy 😋👍🥳,1
Big fan 😉😉,1
😁😊😊👍,1
I'm sorry but Songbyrds husband really creeps me out lol and foodie beauty really sitting there passing gas and not caring? How disgusting can you be?! No manners or self respect. Anyways I love your videos 😁 God bless ❤,0
"I love how respectful Vox is even when he's talking about cringy moment .

EDIT: Thank you all for the likes <3",1
"""im sure foodie beauty is a lovely person"" 

foodie beauty: is racist and xenophobic",0
"What Songbyrd's husband eats kinda looks like bean soup (we call it bableves in hungarian). We just use a different type of bean. It's actually delicious,one of my fav soup",1
I don't understand how People can Just fart while having a meal and Just move on,0
No.. foodie beauty is a horrible human.,0
The amount of effort you put into each and every video is so awesome . I Love your vids!!,1
"Foodie beauty is actually a terrible person … and context behind that video is her “cheat meal” was at 5am while her boyfriend at the time got woken up by her and had to get ready. She had eaten a salad and cottage cheese the night before I believe and while yes she ate it, it wasn’t fulfilling so she at this pre-breakfast. She genuinely is vile iykyk",0
"We Filipinos eat with our hands on some occasions (and if we know how, because not everyone does) but there are limitations in what we can eat with our hands. The idea of mushing mac and cheese between my fingers already make me squirm and it feels so wrong. It's like using chopsticks on spaghetti",0
I love that Sammie boy has admitted the only reason his videos are like that is because he gets tons more views 😂,1
"follow me ♥

Muito bom 🤤,1
The  expression  on  gongsams  face  let's  me  know  he's  very  satisfied  with  the  meal. 👍🤣,1
What a delicious meal to watch on a Saturday night 😋😊 everything looks very good 👍,1
Everytime tzuyang-nim post a video I need to have food with me so I won't feel hungry while watching her eats. And this time I eat samyang and I eat it so fast that I dont even realize I stop eating before her ㅋㅋ Thank you tzuyang-nim and for everyone on behind the scenes too who works hard to keep on making all this video. I really² love it <3,1
"Convenience store-bought food may be appetizing, however, there’s still nothing that could ever beat homemade meals and even street food. The way tzuyang eats and every single food on the table as if she could consume a lot, lot more than that can be so satisfying to watch.",1
"This calls for another food 🥳 Everytime I watch Tzuyang, I always make sure there's a food present with me. Can't help not to crave for food when she's doing her thing 🤭",1
I’m always amazed and mesmerized by your eating skills. You are delightful.,1
"I was amazed seeing Tzuyang used her left hand while using the chopsticks, on most of her videos the chopsticks were on the right Really a talented lady with an unbelievable appetite! Love everything about her 💚",1
and she did it all by wearing a white shirt and not getting any stains on it???? I'm even more impressed....,1
I love Tzuyang  look when she’s starving and has to wait.it’s almost like she’s a little sad,1
don't click this if you're a kid.. . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GI4Gzu9XSY,0
This channel really has motivated me to stay as far away from junk food as possible,1
"Thanks for being a lesson for millions of us! You are just one person spreading a message to remain healthy without you knowing it! May God bless you and keep you safe. I weighed 235 myself and on my way to touch 200 lbs. Whenever I am about to lose my motivation, I would at least watch you for a minute as a reminder..",1
Why did i genuinely smile when they were being nice to eachother and laughing together,1
Lets just take a moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into making us want to jump off a cliff 🥰💗,1
Nick is in the prime position to have a body transformation and become a legend on the internet.,1
*Lets just take a moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into making us want to jump off a cliff*🥰💗,1
There's something so disturbing about Crystal and Chuck other than neglecting Evan.,0
"Smh she has so much food aggression, she could stand to share a raggedy fry. There is no way I'd get an attitude with my husband over a fry.",0
"I remember when I tried to swallow a cheese stick whole... Damn near choked on the cheese. I thought it was the end. 😅

That being said, I'll never understand why Crystal eats/races like that with all the chewing difficulties she has. 🤷🏼‍♀️",0
Now I’m positive that ketchup packet has been all over the floor and she’s just lickin all over it! 🤢🤮,0

Ssoyoung I should simply call you my appetizer 🥰 you make me crave all your cookings 🤗 I need a Ssoyoung in my house to pamper me with all these delicacies 😍,1
I like Ssoyoung's Mukbang not because of the food but because of the way she express her emotions.,1
"Her expressions are so good, her videos makes you feel like you're joining the meal",1
Ssoyoung should open a restaurant where she sells food that she eats in her videos. I would honestly eat there.,1
The dialog and sounds of her just pouring a can of pop is what keeps me eating with Ssoyoung whenever I get a chance.,1

"When he took his hiatus, I genuinely thought that Nick was gonna finally take care of his health. It's a shame to see that nothing's changed",0
You can't help someone who refuses to help themselves.,0
You can just tell how hard he's trying to stay in character and relevant at this point. It's even more sad than before.,0
Nick is the only YouTuber who can call me a peasant on camera…and make me laugh abt it😭😭😭,1

this video is so comforting not only cuz its a sibling video but watching your food videos really help me and my struggle with eating and anyone out there who has the same troubles know you’re not alone we can do this🤎,1
The relationship Ashley has with her siblings is honestly so funny and cute😂💌,1
laughed so hard when Amber said her friend fell sleep at Disneyland and she waited an hour for him to wake up and it was his best nap ever. best friend award goes to her,1
ahhh this video feels so nostalgic having the siblings and the cousins 🥹 it's always extra chaotic and extra dynamic with them 💗,1

I enjoyed the video! Now I'm hungry 🤣🤣,1
"Gongsam é limpo e organizado, da gosto ver os vídeos dele 😍👏. Esse frango ficou crocante ein 😋💜",1
Gongsam is a really neat and clean mukbanger and I really like this bout him and the way he shoots his video has a lots of effort in it and he also teaches us how to make that food while lots of mukbangers just start their video without showing any food recipe hats of to Gong Sam 👍👍👍👍,1
GONGSAM SIEMPRE SE ME ANTOJAN TUS COMIDAS!!😋,1
Que vídeo perfeito! Um dia ainda chego neste nível 💚💚,1

"I've recently tried pibb zero sugar and it is amazing! If you like cherry flavored soda I'd definitely give it a try 😁 I do like the A&W root beer zero sugar also, tried it because you recommended it!",1
"I'm super late today Candy. Having one of those lazy days. Those hotdogs, tots and fries look amazing!!! I don't eat hotdogs anymore but that doesn't mean I don't miss them and crave them. Love the color red on you, and dark greens. Hair always looks so pretty and so shiny. Glad you're feeling better.",1
"Candy, if you are experiencing vaginal bleeding after menopause, it is not normal.  It could be a sign of, among other things, endometrial/uterine or cervical cancer.  Get to the doctor NOW.  It could also be a sign of less serious things like fibroids, polyps, hormonal imbalances.",0
Hey Candy!!! Good seeing you today! I love a good hot dog. We have a place here in Raleigh called Char grill and they make the absolute best hamburgers and hot dogs ever!!!!!! Sending you huge hugs gf!!!!!,1
That looks so delicious have a wonderful day,1
"Glad your back, Candy, hope your taking more care of yourself. Grilled hot dogs are the best. Big beef ones are very tasty, depends on the type and the brand. 😋🌭🌭",1
Hearing what you said made me sad never think your worthless believe in yourself never let the opinions of others stop you or bring you down I suffer mental health issues and I feel this way about myself alot I hate seeing other people feeling the same because I know how bad it feels I pray you find strength in yourself x,0
"Love when you talk about you ,  glad you are feeling a little better in yourself ,  we all have our inner demons ,  people who want to judge and bully say more about themselves than they do about you ,  you are a sweet lady ,  like I said I love hearing your stories ,  I tell myself all the time get a grip of yourself , I must do this I must do that ,  when you are stuck at home all by yourself it’s hard to motivate ,  f the negative comments you don’t need them , I’m sure there are more love than hate , stay awesome",1
The snacks might take the edge off the addiction ☺️ Good job identifying that. Less is more 💜,1
Pin me pliss I Love you 💘,1
Mmm que rico se  mira.  🤤🤤🤤,1
I love how much time and effort u put into these and I wish u could cook a meal for me. And this is the best asmr I seen in a while keep up the good work,1
Nobody’s gonna talk about how great she is at cooking and makes a great amount of food just to entertain us?,1
The fact that the mushrooms were so crunchy was soooooooo satisfying,1
I love when she chew the mushrooms the sound is so good,1
Обожаю эти грибы хрустящие 😋😋😋🤩🤩🤩,1

This was arguably The Office's funniest script yet.  What a barrage of awesome lines.  BJ Novak wrote this one.,1
"Kavin - Milf , in background Stanley laughing. That's why The Office is so unique. When I re watch it I always look at the background to see what other characters are doing.",1
"Excited for future episodes, it's gonna get better from here.",1
"I love how Marketa felt that European joke, her face just said “Goddamn it”",1
Can’t wait when we get to the series finale and the intro will be a full blown rave for the normies.,1
Finalmente essa luta épica 🔥🔥🔥,1
the animation gets me every time 🔥,1
The hype reaction of these reactors show how good Boruto anime is despite the hate it received at its early seasons. It definitely worth watching,1
EXCITED FOR NEXT EPS 🔥🔥,1
ah yes my young lord boruto proving minatos genes were passed to him. how he used his vanishing rasengan so fast and still met up to hit that backflip and dodge saradas chidori- TOOO BEAUTIFUL… AND MY GOAT MOMO UGH,1
SARADA USING CHIDORI IS ONE OF THE BEST SCENES IN ALL BORUTO UNIVERSE!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAA,1
"I can’t even express or explain how legendary and outstanding the voice actor for Thorfinn was in this episode. That scream. Holy shit. Reminded me of Erens screams in Attack on Titan. Definitely one of my favorite moments of anime so far. It’s literally his origin  story.  

Now I’m wondering if Askeladd really wanted Thors to be the leader.. was that laugh a change within the moment? I’m not sure but wow.. What an episode. 


‼️ FULL UNCUT REACTION to THIS REACTION & EVERY REACTION I UPLOAD on my Patreon ‼️

www.Patreon.com/NicholasLightTV",1
"The sad part is, when Askellad asked Thors to be their leader, he was actually serious. But as he realized it was impossible, he had to laugh it off to save face in front of his men.",0
This show is about to pick up and you’re gonna love these characters more and more as it goes Nick,1
Thorfinn screaming his lungs out saying he’s going to kill them gives me the biggest chills because you can hear all the pain in his voice but at the same time you can hear how serious he is 😢😫 I can’t want to see how he will accomplish this ❤,0
"*_""A true Warrior doesn't need a sword.""_*
- Thors the Troll

One of the best lines in the series",1
Such a good episode. Thorfinn’s voice reached all of us man,1
Great reaction! Askeladd was actually serious about having Thors becoming their leader but he said he was joking when he saw the disapproval on his face.,1
Thorfinns scream gets me every time. The amount of emotion that was put into it just blew me away.,1
"Season 1 of Vinland Saga is one of the best first seasons of anime ever, and season 2 coming out in the beginning of next year is going to be even better. Truly excited to see your upcoming reactions for this masterpiece of a tale.",1
"Now this is a Try Not To Laugh challenge.
Actually funny clips one after another after another... Tyrone straining and struggling not to laugh...
A real ab workout!",1
"I don't always agree with them, but, they ARE hilarious!",1
"I didn’t even try, I just needed a good laugh today and this was perfect",1
I only lost cause Tyrone was looking like his whole face was gonna explode holding that in,0
Their faces! It's so funny to see 2 buffed up dudes talking like that and just joking around,1
This was hard but I made it! Kevin saying supplement wrong numerous times took everything from me... idk why that part was so funny to me.,1
"I have a 22 year old son. He has had two falling outs in his life. Both times, they cussed each other, took a little time apart and eventually made up and became bros again. I have a 17 year old daughter. I've lost count of her falling outs and those girls are dead to her. Half the women my wife considers friends she comes home from hanging out with them and just rags them to obliteration to me.",0
"As a male RN who worked with almost all women, Bill is right on.",1
"""We brought you into this world "" 
Nope 
My mother did and I respect her for this but I refuse to respect someone based on their gender or race or anything else other than your behaviour and character",0
"Speaking only from my experience as a 40 year old man, most of the guys I knew in highschool are all still friends...  pretty much all the girls hate each other.

Two women will stare daggers at each other because the other one wore the same color as her.

Two guys can get into a fist fight, and if the right song comes on the jukebox, they become best friends, and spend the rest of the night drinking and talking about music.",0
"I am grateful for the woman that brought me into this world. Not only that, she loved me and supported me, in ways no one would. She went above and beyond, while others have been one disappointment after another. I owe her everything and I help her out whenever she asked. 

But the thing is, only one woman brought me into this world. And that credit does not roll over to the rest of the gender.",1
"Okay, this gonna be a long one, sorry about that.

I'm French, and there's an interesting fact about France, it's that we are brutally honest. Most other people don't like that, so we are called arrogant, rude, obnoxious, but we are not, we are just honest, and people don't like honesty. When we are considered high in the list of nations where spouses cheat on each other, it's not because we cheat more than you, it's just because we honestly answered the questions. You're probably wondering where I'm going with that.

Well, I was reading all the coments about women being mean to each other, not staying friends with each other, yada-yada-yada, and I can't relate. At all. Because it doesn't work like that here. I still know a lot of female who were already friend in High School (and I'm 40), whenever I see my mother, or my Girlfriend, or my Girl Friends, they are just friendly.

I dunno, it's probably only on screen, but the number of time I saw in TV shows or movies a group of girls being friendly, then as soon as one leave, they all turn to bitch on this one; that's something I never saw in France. They bitch on her while she is here, and she doesn't take it badly, because she does the same.

So I was wondering, why is that ? Why are they still friends if it's different for others, then I realized, because we are honest.

My female friends won't hesitate to look at each others and say ""Wow girl, you look like shit today"" ""Didn't you put on weight recently? Maybe you should work out"" and for me, that's a healthy relationship.

Why does American males manage to stay friends ? Because they trash talk each other, because they are honest, because they say things as they are. Yeah, sometimes we have fallouts, but we mend things,.

Why can't female American stay friends ? Because they are sneaky, they lie, ""Ooooh, you look gorgeous girl"", ""You are so strong, I envy you"", while not thinking any of that. Sooner or later, in any relationship based on lie, the truth will come out, and it's not going to be pretty.",0

More than a thousand chapters and for me it is still the most dramatic Luffy fight. In no other have I felt that it has had to be pushed to the limit as in this one.,1
So glad Usopp returned for this part of the arc tho we never got an explanation to where Sogeking went,1
Definitely one of Luffy's toughest opponents ever seeing that Lucci's fighting skills were superior than his pre-timeskip.,1
When I first watched this I was so hyped up I was cheering for Luffy to win I felt nervous and also I felt like I was there in a way,1
The Ussop moment before the finisher really made this the best main villian finisher in the series. So much better than the Laido finisher,1
thank you so much for letting us relive this epicness 💯💯,1
God i love the feeling i get from this anime once it has my 100% attention i live for these moments 🔥 SHG4L,1
Still the best fight of the series to date. And that pop of the gatling is still the most satisfying sound in the show.,1
still one of my top 3 fights of One Piece!,1
I love Dave Chappelle for getting the real truth out there with comedy.,1
This is true dark humor. Love this man.,1
I have watched all of Dave’s standups MULTIPLE times ! He is so funny !! I can’t get enough 😂😂😂😂,1
"I've seen about 20 reactions to this, but Asia's was my favorite. Love this channel. keep it up.",1
Dave is such a comedic genius!,1
OMG! Chapelle is the greatest!!🤣🤣 Great reaction!!🤠🤓,1

"Please react to MV

This one also looks promising because the directors are same and Hrithik looks fine as always. Also excited because the BGM is done by Sam C.S who is an underrated music director who composed music for the original Vikram Vedha. Will need to check the songs done by Vishal-Shekhar who are also good music directors. Excited for the trailer!!,1
"The Tamil one, Sethupathi gave a more calmer yet menacing version of Vedha whereas Hrithik here seems to be out and out brutal. Really eager to see how good he has been throughout the entire movie.",1
I've watched Original vikram vedha (tamil) and honestly I just loved Vijay setupathi as vedha and his mannerisms !! But I would love to see hrithik as vedha 🔥,1
"Gave me goosebump at the last, hearing the original bgm 🔥🔥",1
"This got me so hyped, especially Hrithik being the highlight for me. Also, the it factor for me was to see such a diverse talented cast and the bgm as well. Achara saying that it wasn't convincing actually makes me believe that she's just still adjusting to seeing Hrithik in a negative role because those eyes stood out for me, giving that maniac sadistic vibe that it was supposed to. And the background setting of Imambara from Lucknow though>>>>",1
"Despite being a remake,  everyone is excited and going to support this film because of its outstanding starcast . Their performances is going to be fire 🔥🔥 , especially of hrithik . He never disappoints , always tries to bring something different to the audience .",1
"Tamil is a tremendous success. May they get that success or more in Hindi too. Looking at the casting, there is hope, and so are the directors. The end bgm is 🔥...",1
"While Everyone is Appreciating Greek God........let's take a moment to appreciate Saif as well, This Man is definition of diverse roles, from playing funny goofy college guys to playing Intense roles like Sartaj, Udaybhan ( in tanhaji) and Vikram, he proved that atleast one major Khan in industry works in realistic cinema as well. he also have maintained his physique and look at such age...... definitely deserves appreciation",1
Sorry about the bland background everyone. We will back to our original space for episode 4. Hope you guys liked our reactions!!! 🐳🐳🐳,1
It’s ok Don’t worry about the background Im glad my favourite YouTubers are doing their reaction ❤️,1
"the brides father in this is in a ton of dramas, he's really good at playing harsh grandfather or CEO types, usually if he's in a drama I watch it",1
Im gonna become your patreon Just because this show and those hats. I love you guys!,1
"Her dad was being sarcastic (in the most compassionate way) when she brought him seaweed sushi from the expensive restaurant. Like, she had the option to bring him literally anything else from a place that's 300K per meal, and she brings something similar to what he spends all day making. It's like bringing a sandwich shop owner a sandwich with fancier ingredients. 

But from Woo Young Woo's perspective, gimbap/seaweed sushi is her favorite thing, so it was a gift of love for her dad.",1
They fell in love with the lawyer with the wedding dress and that smile,1
"This movie was tricky, with the amount of swearing in it, YouTube kept restricting it as 18+ and blocked in some countries/territories so I had to mute all the f words, so that everyone can have access to the video.",0
"It's so cute that Dasha was so happy when she was able to pronounce ""thriller.""",1
"As insane as Walter is, he was correct about the ""kidnappers"" being amateurs, and the toe belonging to someone else.",0
"The Coen Brothers are two of the greatest American directors. I Iike all of their films, but, as others have suggested, “Fargo” and “Raising Arizona” are essential films to see.",1
"The fact that Walter practically causes half the film’s problems yet it turns out in the end, not to mention for all for the wrong reasons, he was right about everything.",0
This film becomes much more enjoyable as you watch it several times.,1
"For how over-the-top Walter is, he is a lovable character.",1
"Having enjoyed two of the Coen Brothers' movies, you should probably watch a few more. 
I think ""Fargo"" is probably the one I would recommend most.
""Raising Arizona"", ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", and ""True Grit"" would probably also be on the short list for follow-up movies.",1
"Julianne Moore is an excellent actress, here playing an artist who wants to be a single mother.",1
"True story and sad about Val Kilmer having throat cancer and pretty much unable to act again, and Tom Cruise fought to have Val Kilmer to be in the film. Writing in his condition and his appearance in the film was absolutely beautiful.",1
"38:48 A sequel that deserves - and gets - a wonderful reaction from Mish & Ellie. The final half hour of this is a real emotional wringer no matter what – but it’s especially intense and all the more adrenalin-filled, if like Mish & Ellie, you’ve seen the first film already.",1
"Michelle: ""It's a privilege to fly with Maverick.""
Ellie: ""Tell that to his dad...""
Legit spat tea & choked at that one...🤣😂😅👍
Re Mav's F-18 being unable to fly again after his 'demo', pulling Gs damages the structure of aircraft. Too many Gs will break the airframe immediately, but even pulling less than that limit will still do damage: microscopic cracks that build up over time, invisibly weaking the airframe until it breaks, sometimes during normal non-extreme flying. To combat this, all aircraft have a rated 'G-life', that is the maximum cumulative number of Gs they can pull in their lives before they're retired as a precautionary measure. Mav's extreme maneuvers during the demo may not have broken his F-18 immediately, but they may have used up so much of it's G-life that it's effectively scrap anyway.",0
"It's really cool to compare the leap in cinematography when it comes to filming the action with the fighters. In the 80s it was amazing, but now it looks pretty calm, and the shots in this movie taken from inside and outside the planes are amazing.",1
"I've been waiting for this one since you did the first. I'm so conflicted. I spent most of my life using Top Gun as an example that not all great movies need a sequel, then the bastards made one, and then they added insult to injury by making it so fucking good lol.",0
"It's the best action movie seen all year, and it's understandable why Tom Cruise went out of his way to get this movie seen in theaters. That feeling of watching a movie and feeling all the adrenaline was almost gone.

Good reaction, girls.",1
"Ellie loves Goose a lot. Few times Goose was shown through flashbacks or mentioned, she was emotional.",1
One of the best movies ive ever seen! Honestly i wasn't even a big fan of the first top gun so i had no expectations with this one but it blew me away!,1
Y’all know that JR and Kane clip made my day,1
Kane had some of the best returns in his career. The pop's that he got were ridiculously unreal. They should've given Kane more World Championships than they did.,1
The way Bischoff sold and got hit with Edgr's spear honestly looks like he died especially when it looked like he hit his head on the bottom turnbuckle,0
"Kinda sad that Cena's return at MITB wasn't on here, but it was still a great video none the less.",1
JR going wild when Cena returned in the royal rumble made the moment even more epic and iconic.,1
My #1 would have been Cena returning at MITB last year.  Hearing Cole sound like Joey Styles when Cena came out was hilarious.,1
Sting returning at wm 31 and rock returning at 2012 on RAW was litrerly the loudest pop and commentators were absolutely going wild.,1
"Matt Smith portrayal of Daemon Targaryen was nothing short of perfection, he plays the character the way I imagined he would be in a live action format. Can't wait for yah to see more of him, also ladies this show is about the dance of dragons so yah won't be seeing the mad king in this show.",1
"Matt Smith is another example of don't judge a casting until you see them in the role, because I was like bruh they got Dr who to play one of the most badass characters in the history of westeros then I saw this episode and was highly impressed.",1
"I liked that they showed Daemon crying at The Funeral, they took great effort to show how Antagonistic he is, but then showed us he clearly loves his family.",1
As a fan of GRRM. And reading all materials associated with this story. I must agree with George. Dameon Targaryen is my favorite characters within these histories. Definitely top two. #I ride with Dameon. Lololol. Get ready for a ride.,1
Ned Stark would have never ever sent one of his daughters to do foolishness like that And it makes me miss him yet again,0
Ladies Daemon Targaryen is George Martin's favorite character in all books he's written.  This show will be fun with him being the instigator,1
Your guys reaction is EVERYTHING. This is gonna be a fun series to follow ur reactions on! I can’t wait. Y’all had me rolling 😂. So much shock and awe 🫢. This show had me hooke within minutes! So nice to be back 😅,1
5:14 Dreams are extremely important to Targaryens. The reason they were able to escape the Doom of Valyria is because a Targaryen girl dreamed of the Doom and was able to warn her family.,1
so much practice and talent,1
Nice,1
"Increíble baile me encanta, las cuatro son unas reinas,  lisa la mejor 🥰🥰🥰💕💞,  jenlisa 💞",1
"they look amazing!! the stage presence in their dancing!! they do it the perfect amount to look elegant, smooth, and powerful. and the backup dancers tooo!! great performance :)",1

"They never disappoint!! proud of them all! blackpink is really the revulotion they are purr, but blinks please keep attention for spotify! please stream and listen there too!",1
"My theory here:

- That ""plant creature"" could possibly be that Fungus but in a more mutated form. As seen previously in the ""Missing Persons"" and  ""Autopsy Report"" videos, whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, they get covered in this black coloured fungus. This fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto (mutating itself onto the dead body). Given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate (100, 1000 or even millions of years at best) and also given that how time passes strangely in the Backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the ""Informational"" video with the date 2/9/1990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished, however it wasn't teleportation but instead time travel. That researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the ""Presentation"" video with the date 5/8/1990 when the alarm rang out and CCTV footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by Async. So by this logic, the whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time. The creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash. As seen in Kane's secret video of ""9780415263573"", this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed, the driver wasn't able to push the brakes in time to stop the car. Thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage. The driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there. The fungus grew on him and later the entire room in it's mutated form. Also it sounded like the creature was yelling out ""Help"" in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room (which was seen in the ""original found footage"" video and later the ""Pitfalls"" video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of it's last victims and in this case, even it's originator which is the driver). It's all just a theory which I just came up with. Don't take it canon lol.",0
"Speaking about Backrooms, You definitely should check out ""The Complex: Found Footage"" (free game on Steam).
It's HEAVILY inspired by Kane Pixels version and NAILS the vibe.",1
"Kane has proven without a doubt that he truly has serious talent when it comes to storytelling and world building. I can’t wait to see what he has in store for us later down the line. Glad to see you’re still keeping up with the series, Ryan!",1
"Lucky that steel energy card wasnt very old. Some collectors would be having a mental breakdown if it was. Also, love to see u got pokemon cards too and love to see more backrooms content!",1
The humor and jokes of Ryan is just top tier easily one of the best comedic gaming YouTubers,1
Imagine all the friends and family who went missing without a trace ended up in the Backrooms.,0
"12:03 I agree with Ryan, the sound design is on point, animations, world building too. Kane Pixels is a very talented 17 year old person",1
"No sequel to a movie that is over 30 years old should be this damn spectacular! I saw this opening night in IMAX and it was one of the absolute best moviegoing experiences of my life. The sound of the jets flying by, the literal feeling of the vibrations in your seat when the G forces kick in, and especially the visuals of seeing everything from the point of view of the pilots. I legitimately believed during the final dogfight that Maverick was going to die, so few movies today make me believe that!

On top of all that, the story is so freaking amazing. The theme of showing how fighter pilots are still needed even in the age of drones, the story of Rooster learning to not just forgive Maverick but to let go of being so overly careful in his flying and “don’t think just fly”. And of course the most emotionally powerful if the movie when Maverick visits Iceman. Even though he has retired due to his throat cancer and has difficulty speaking he still managed to give an absolutely heartbreaking performance.😭😭😭😭

Thank you Tom Cruise for fighting so hard to get this movie in theaters.👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽",1
Tom Cruise is truly the embodiment of megastardom! One of the best films in decades,1
"I love how Hangman could’ve been a typical cliche bad guy and he absolutely isn’t. He’s cocky and arrogant in Top Gun because that’s what Top Gun brings out of young pilots: their competitive nature. 

Once he’s on the aircraft carrier, he is all business, encouraging, and ready to help. I love that.",1
"Sad that Val Kilmer (Iceman) has been dealing with throat cancer these last few years (you saw him in Willow). But its beautiful how they wrote his illness into the story, and gave his character weight and honor.

He also played Batman once. 🦇",1
"Spider-Man: No Way Home and Top Gun: Maverick both brought back the moviegoing experience in huge droves as both films became one of the first films to gross over $1 billion worldwide at the box office since the pandemic began. Also, Tom Cruise and Paramount made the right decision delaying this for two years because it's a film that's made for the big screen and everyone knows that.",1
"15:45 Val Kilmer lost his voice for real due to throat cancer. But they used an A.I. computer program to digitally recreate his voice. It was nice to see them bring him onboard for this movie. Heartwarming and one of the most amazing moments in the film. All because Tom wanted him to be a part of this movie so much.

I got to meet Val Kilmer at a convention a few years ago after he beat cancer but lost his voice. He was one the bravest and kindest guys ever.",1
I used to own a Betamax (Similar to VHS) tape of Top Gun many years ago and me and my 2 kids (aged 5 and 4) would watch it almost daily. Now they're grown up and have their own family and yet we got to watch Maverick together at home here in the Philippines. It was an absolutely amazing sequel and yes we all felt the stress and emotions just as you did Magy. Your reactions were so on point and wonderful to watch. Thank you!,1
I'm with you Magy; I loved this movie and felt it was actually better than the first!,1
"Fun fact: The reason why the F-35 fighter that Maverick mentions when he's briefed on the target is not the ideal candidate for the mission is because of the GPS jamming.

In actuality behind the scenes, the F-35 didn't have room in the cockpit for the cameras that they outfitted in the F-18s. They needed to have the actors ride backseat with real pilots in order to film the flight sequences and the F-35 couldn't accommodate that",0
Damn really good to see your reaction on Indian songs.. hope you will soon check out the trailer of Brahmastra.. it is really in trending and one of the most anticipated Bollywood film of 2022,1
The fact that people are finally appreciating their talent ..loveeeee ❤️❤️❤️❤️thank you for reacting 🙏🏻,1
"Didn't expect this here, but as an Indian, I love it!",1
"You need to react to ""Kamli"" from Dhoom 3. She is Katrina❤️ the goddess herself you'll see her dance and I bet you both bruh you won't be able to take your eyes off her. She be breaking it down and grooving. Mesmerizing us n keeping us glued to the screen.",1
Lovely! I abs adore Hrithik! If you enjoy Hrithik’s videos-  another one with good dance and fab music pls react to ‘Fire’ from Kites movie! The song is epic :),1
"She is actually a great dancer too. React to Kamli, it's her best performance.",1
"you guys gotta react to ""tu meri"" from the same bang bang movie, amazing song in my opinion!",1
If you want to see dance moves of hritik roshan you should react on -  Mein aisa kyu hoon . And hritik is fabulous actor . Please react on Krish 3 movie trailer and War movie trailer .,1
"Loved your reactions, I'm here from neel's channel and i recommend you to react to Arijit Singh, he's one of the best artist india produced and most followed artist on Spotify from India, you already listened to one of his songs ghungroo, you react to his live performances from award shows or any of his soulful songs like laal Ishq,janam Janam, phir bhi tumko chahunga and so on....",1

This show being back in the bar makes me so nostalgic. Nostalgic we all felt when GOT was the most hyped show. After one episode I am optimistic about House of the Dragon and it will be a pleasure to watch these reactions again. Cheers!,1
"The genuine disgust everyone had at Otto telling Alicent to go to the King and give him ""comfort"" while wearing one of her mother's dresses is everything. I think Daemon is going to be a standout character thanks to Matt Smith's nuance portrayal of him. I loved Smith's delivery, and Daemon's blunt acknowledgement of the truths Viserys can't bear to face.

As ever, thank you so much for sharing your reactions! Looking forward to the season to come!",1
"Poor Viserys. He's a good dude, but he suffers the human flaw that almost everyone suffers: he's adverse to hearing harsh truths about himself. Even from his own brother.",0
when viserys was talking about the winter coming dany's theme was also playing it was so sad 😭,0
"Que nostálgico ver sus reacciones, me acuerdo que esperaba después de cada episodio la reacción del bar. Faltó gente, pero sigue siendo el mismo placer.
Saludo desde Argentina, de un fan de GOT, que los conoció gracias a la serie ❤️",1
I love how we never heard Daemon say “the heir for a day”,1
"Green Haired Girl is back and giggly as ever lol she’s dope though. My guy Shaggy is by her side of course. Al Roker Jr. is trying to be a scene stealer, he’s bringing all the sass. John Cena to his left is completely unbothered. David Spade is behind them for support. Hagrid and Chris Evans have new seats. This is great Sean!",1
Such a good feeling seeing you guys back at the bar Watching Game of thrones. This just feels right.,1
"Targaryans have prophetic dreams, Called Dragon Dreams, However as Maester Aemon said ""I see them in my dreams, Sam. I see a red star bleeding in the sky. I still remember red. I see their shadows on the snow, hear the crack of leathern wings, feel their hot breath. My brothers dreamed of dragons too, and their dreams killed them, every one."" The grief and glory of house Targaryen",0
"Daemon is being made a lot more nuanced than he was in Fire and Blood. The “Heir For A Day” brothel scene really makes me question him. We saw that he’s not enjoying himself at all, despite frequenting brothels before and renting this one out specifically to celebrate the Gold Cloaks’ accomplishments with the boys. Mysaria seems to be an enabling force, goading him into his darker tendencies. When he says “we must all grieve in our own ways”, I think he actually was somewhat saddened by Baelon’s and Aemma’s death. Daemon does want power, but he does love his brother.

“Over the centuries, House Targaryen has produced both great men and monsters. Prince Daemon was both. In his day there was not a man so admired, so beloved, and so reviled in all Westeros. He was made of light and darkness in equal parts. To some he was a hero, to others the blackest of villains.” - Archmaester Gyldayn",0
"Absolutely in love with this new show already. Loved all the actors and Rhaenyra's ""Dracarys"" was absolutely amazing!",1
That childbirth scene was gruesome. The screams affected me just as much as Shireen’s burning at the stake.😫,0
Targaryans have a history of putting a lot of stock in their dreams. The only reasons the house survived the doom of Valyria is because one of them had a dream it would happen and they packed up and went to Dragonstone. Even in Game of Thrones Dany had a dream about stepping into the fire that hatched her eggs. That's why she did it. This is the problem with watching this show and criticizing certain characters without having any book context at all.,0
"My underestanding is that the wife wasn't going to survive either way. So it was a matter of ""letting the gods take them both"" or actively killing his wife to save the baby. An absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it. We've seen some horrible stuff, but her death scene was up there with one of Ramsay's scenes. I also think, given recent political events in the US, it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from Marvel. Not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come.

Also, I hear this series will be far more morally grey than Game of Thrones ever was. Daemon gives me Ramsay or Joffrey vibes, but he'll be much more complex and less villainous. While he seems to operate on self-motivation, his violence isn't wanton or random like Joffrey or Ramsay. So I picture him being closer to a Cersei/Jaime style character. But if anything he absolutely gives PEAK Targaryen vibes and Matt Smith gives a stellar performance.

I'm really excited to see Corlys Valaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen. A shame we haven't seen much of Rhaenys but I picture her having some of Cersei's chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown. I hate to touch on this, but I know Corlys's racial ""change"" was of concern, and I originally had slight concern myself. Not because some ""OMG WOKE"" bs, but because of the Velaryons and the Targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation, so I prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one. But if you think about it, the light complexion of the Targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins. Furthermore, Valyria was awfully close to the Summer Isles and Sothoryos. So to me, Corlys is more what I would envision the original Valyrians would look like, so it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Especially after seeing him on screen. He seems like a GREAT character already and I think (and hope) he's up there with Davos.

 Otto Hightower gives strong Tywin and Littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all. He *does* seem like a *type* of man-of-honor, but more in the sense of being a strict rule-follower stuck in the old ways.

And then obviously Viserys is the Ned Stark of the series. I LOVE seeing that name reclaimed. And while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity, I'm glad he apologized to Rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her. I especially like that when brought up with the council, the first response was ""There's never been a queen"" but one of the others was quick to chime in with ""Only out of precedent and tradition"". It's nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has ""hah, but she's a WOMAN!"" Maybe Rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had.

Also while the age difference between him and Alicent is a little insane, and I don't like Otto pimping out his daughter like that, I do think they would legitimately treat each other well. Probably erring on the side of Viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it.

Most of all, the show felt like we jumped straight into S3 or S4 of Game of Thrones.",0
"Existem cantores bons, ótimos, excelentes e existe DIMASH, simplesmente incrível, um grande abraço do BRASIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷💖",1
This AveMaria composed by Igor Krutoy. Sang by Dimash. As you see this song is amazing 😊😍,1
"The composer of this is the piano player, Igor Krutoy. He came out of semi-retirement to work with Dimash. He has composed for people like Lara Fabian and Andrea Bocelli. 😄

Igor wrote a post about this song on his IG:

""One evening, about three months before the ""New Wave"", Dimash called me and asked if I could write ""Ave Maria "" for him, explaining that he wanted to sing something in that style... Coincidentally I had a free evening and I gladly sat down at the piano and, remembering the Italian formula of responsibility, worked with inspiration until I achieved the desired result. . . After taking a few days for the composition to ""rest"" in my ears, soul, and heart, I sent it to Dimash, who literally within half an hour answered that it was exactly what he wanted to hear. And of course, the reception and applause given to Dimash by the audience at the ""New Wave"" show what a happiness it is to do what I love, to write for such a genius singer, to evoke deep emotion in the audience and to be in demand... Just a short essay on "" What is happiness?""""",1
"Me dio risa cuando estaban hablando y riéndose antes de que Dimash abriera la boca y emitiera el primer sonido! Se quedaron mudos! Esta es la capacidad que tiene Dimash de cautivar al público, sin decir una sola palabra! Es maravilloso, esta es una composición de Igor Krutoy especialmente para Dimash, no tiene letra para que las personas de cualquier credo puedan disfrutarla, y vaya que lo logra! Gracias por su sincera admiración al magnifico Dimash! ❤️🌹🇲🇽❤️🌹🇲🇽❤️🌹🇲🇽",1
"This vocalise of ""Ave Maria"" was composed by Igor Krutoy especially for Dimash.  It goes without saying that this newest version of the traditional song(s) is almost beyond belief in its simplicity and power.  Nobody can pull off a vocalise as well as Dimash, the greatest vocalist I have ever heard in my 80+ years on this planet, and I've heard some really great singers along the way, and in every genre ever conceived.  What a blessing to experience this voice, this incomparable talent.  btw: Very nice reaction.",1
"UNBELIEVABLE recently filmed in Germany titled ""The Innovators"" featuring 5 young adults from around the world, who have turned their industries on their heads and impacted them forever.

"I don't care what anyone says about it or how it's not comic accurate, I absolutely adore this movie",1
"Such a shame we haven't got a sequel of this movie, Keanu it's a really good fit for the character.",1
"Also loved the portrayal of Lucifer. Al Pacino did his cool version of him around this time too, but Stormare blew him away",1
"I would really like to see a sequel to the movie, with Keanu Reeves coming back as the titular character and Guillermo Del Toro directing.
This was back in 2018-2019, but with their busy schedules, looks like we might have to wait a little while longer.",1
"Yay! This movie is underrated, IMO. So glad you’re seeing it. I’m sad Keanu couldn’t get it rolling as a franchise.",1
"This was a great movie on its own and would've been great as a stand-alone series. Shame it didn't get a sequel, but I like it as it is as well. I know some people don't like it because of it not reflecting the comics character as much, but I say it was a very good version of it.",1
"I really like Tilda Swinton in this movie and even though a lot of people didn’t like it when it came out, I did. I’m glad you’re watching it now Greg!! Good stuff!!",1
I still think this movie is visually stunning for the time that it was made every shot and all the CGI and practical effects look so amazing in this movie.,1
you need to watch his “first guy to play tag” and the first guy to play duck duck goose. one his funniest ones,1
Love Kristen’s laugh! 😊,1
The faces Kristen was making before starting the video had me laughing pretty hard. :),1
I still love how there’s a point where he clearly defogged the goggles.,1
1:47 amazing laugh xD this one made me crack up too xD,1
Love when Jaby cracks up.,1

Kristen's such a vibe tbh 😂,1
"Hrithik once said “giving d audience same thing what they’ve seen is redundant. Give them something more, a little more.” 
N he gave us a lottt more.
We fans r loving him. He’s d most versatile n all rounder actor in Bollywood. Perfect blend of everything",1
"I've just recently watched the original but I've to say that this teaser actually looks really good. I'm not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but I've high hopes from this film because it's the same duo who directed the original one. Personally, I don't have any problems from a remake and I don't think remaking something is a crime. The remake, however, has to be good. If it doesn't justify the acting of the original actors then it's a crime otherwise if it's a remake like Kabir Singh (which is a really good remake) then I don't have any problems and I feel this remake will be genuinely good",1
"Vijay sir has his own charm 🔥
And HR has his own 🔥💯
Please don't compare both are legends ❤️",1
"The intro was so good this time, you guys somehow always manage to outdo yourself each time. Loving how you hype Hrithik, always worth watching your admiration for the right things in Bollywood in your reactions.",1
"Agneepath is the movie you need to watch. Also, Langda Tyagi character in  Omkara actually changed Saif's persona as an actor.",1
"Brilliant teaser, perfect remake, movie may go beyond it since same directors would have streamlined script filling the donts. Moving to the fact of you guys, So you haven't watched Vikram Vedha original and going to love this movie? Upto your choice. Yet, thats hypocrisy.",1
I am Tamil. I love the R.Madhavan/VJS movie. By watching this we might get more footages and backstory that we missed in the tamil version. And Wow Hrithik's craziness is Awesome 🔥🔥🔥,1
"Hrithik is a terrific actor , 
u can't deny 🔥",1

watching Doflamingo’s speech after Reverie is even CRAZIER 😭😭😭,0
This was extremely enjoyable. Notice how we didn't have rob talking shit about Zoro. I hope reactions can be like this from now on,1
It's worth noting that Law's plan was to destroy the SMILE factory to get Kaido mad at Doflamingo so Doflamingo and Kaido would end up fighting each other. Taking down Doflamingo themselves wasn't part of the plan.,0

"I have watched Vikram vedha on youtube in Hindi last year. I don't think, Saif can beat R. Madhwan in acting. R Madhwan surprised us in the end as he looks innocent throughout the whole movie. But Saif doesn't look innocent at all throughout the trailer. R Madhwan's smile was enough to make Vikram vedha a thriller movie.",1
Vijay sethupathi is one of the most talented actor I have seen in south industry n r Madhavan is one of the most underrated actor love the original masterpiece❤️,1
Krk reviews should be released in theatres all reviews one after another for 3 hours it will become blockbuster 😂,1
"Sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on Theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25+ Crores for a movie. Even highly educated Proffesionals (CA's, Engineers, Doctors, Civil Servants etc) do not earn this kind of money in India after 10 year of service. 

A simple logic, if theses actors (Including the Kumars, Khan's, Devgans, Kapoor's, Roshans, etc) start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie,  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price.

These Superstars have built their mansions worth 100+ Crores and secured the life's of their children and grandchildren. They are living king-size life with our hard earned money. I believe we better stick to OTT or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on YouTube or any other app",0
"I always wonder, why his videos are never in trending. They are so hilarious yet to the point.",1
Everyone is busy praising this movie.....but I prefer the original anytime....no comparison there.😂😂😂😂But your reviews are as usual hilarious.,1
"3:13 hilarious review 😅🤣😂😅
I am Pakistani and I always wait for KRK videos, by God big fan KRK bro
I watch your videos everyday because you always made my day with your incredible review, also I'd say KRK's viewer doing unfair with him because he deserves like similar to views, everyone must like his videos because he is doing hard working for us and he always keep us updated about bollywood activities and news, so he deserves for views, like and followers.

"We have a slightly new setup now, so the lighting and audio might go through a few changes over the next week or so while we tinker to see what looks/sounds the best. The audio seems to be a bit jarring at times. Hopefully we can get that fixed! We hope you enjoy the video!

"19:32 ,that's what you got from Daemons smile? how are everyone giving daemon ""villain"" tag so quickly.  It feels like I saw some other episode and many other people saw another. It felt more like ""my brother knows me, he's right, these other idiots know nothing"" smile.
Daemon is Vicious and acts douchy but also cares about his family from the scenes before with rhaenyra & at the funeral.",0
I actually loved Daemon he seems to actually love his family as soon as the king said why would I do that about not making him his hand.Daemons immediate answer was cause I’m your brother!!It didn’t sound like it was a birth right thing but that he was actually hurt his brother didn’t choose him and he’s for sure not wrong the console is playing him they see his weakness and you can afford to show weakness as a leader it’s a fact!,1
So excited you guys are reacting to this. Can’t wait to start this journey with you both! 🙌🏾,1
"After the foul taste the original GoT left in my mouth, I didn't have very high hopes for this. Yet I watched it and it honestly feels like the earlier seasons, maybe not quite there yet, but definitely enough to have me hooked and wanting more of it.

I find it hard to pinpoint Daemon, on the one hand he wants to show strength (the city watch part), but then he's also arrogant (the tournament, claiming victory while the fight wasn't over) and straight up horrible (heir for a day?). But on the other hand, he really cares for Rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her, her father would need him more now than ever before, which shows he also cares for Viserys. I think him calling Viserys weak, was his blunt way of telling Viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king, which is in line with what he did with the city watch, he feels like the king should show his strength.

Viserys seems like he's held things together for those 9 years, but this clearly is coming to an end, I feel like he's made a huge mistake by alienating Daemon, this won't make things easy for Rhaenyra, who already has to fight the fact that some people don't want a woman on the throne. In the end I think it will be between those two and Viserys will be long gone from the picture.",0
"Pretty sure that daemon didn't actually say the ""heir for a day"", even in the books it's implied that Otto might have made it up to drive a wedge between the brothers, and daemon just didn't want to say anything at that moment. He is vile but he has his brothers best intentions in mind for sure",0

The original movie was op and the teaser of this movie looks promising hopefully it would not disappoints us.,1
Casting is looking perfect but it would be more enjoyable if  we didn't know the story bcoz the original Vedha was unpredictable and this time we know each and every move of him.,1
"I think we should give this movie a chance because hritik has never disappointed us in acting from blind to teacher ,from theive to secret agent his acting was always on point",1
"Don’t care if it is a remake or not, if Hrithik Roshan is in it. 🔥🔥",1
"When Hrithik says ""Iss baar sirf majah hi nahi tajub bhi hoga"" at the starting of the teaser makes me feel that there some surprise for the audience or change in the story. I'm too excited for it.",1
I don't care even if it's a remake because I haven't seen the original one and it seems like it would be a good upgraded remake so looking forward 🙌🧐,1
"I have high expectations in this film 
The trailer is soo much exciting",1

"The best part about the teaser is that both Hrithik and Saif look drastically different from R Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi. And very honestly, Hrithik's Vedha is looking slightly more menacing than Vijay's. I'm cautious but highly excited at the same time 🔥🔥🔥I'm quite hopeful towards this movie coz the directors of the original have made this as well and if I'm not wrong they've said it ISN'T a scene to scene remake Hopefully optimistic 🤞🤞",1
"I’m from Chennai, but I’m a big fan of Hrithik, and don’t tell me it’s a remake, it’s a beautiful script which is worth to be filmed again 🔥🔥🔥 and I’m glad Hrithik is doing the villain role",1
I respect to everyone who wear involved in seriously the best piece that ve every seen on YouTube hats off to well all i love your video 💕,1
"Hrithik is next level no one can beat him 🔥🔥🔥
He not copy Vijay setupati he played his character in own swag 😎.
The king of Indian cinema HR 🔥❤️",1
You should watch the original movie featuring R Madhavan and Vijay sethupati..... it's a masterpiece ❤️,1
"First time after a long time after Kabir Singh, this look promising. I watched original. I don't want to know about story line, i just want to see the Maniac and dense acting of these two.",1
It's directed by original director so hell yeah I'm gonna watch it,1
"I love the original Tamil movie. The Tamil version solidified Vijay Sethupathy as my favorite actor. The whole concept of setting up the story in the Vikram Vetal backdrop was so unique. The climax fight- Vedha has a 'come what may'/ unhinged/ chaotic attitude- and the crazy banter between Vikram and Vedha during the fight .. it was absolutely fresh to look at... Personally I love both Saif and Hrithik. I really don't want to compare VJS and Hrithik. I'll be honest, I was skeptical about the remake. But the teaser does look promising. I love Hrithik's attempt at being the unhinged 'Vedha'. Except for the accent, as you rightly pointed out, the teaser does look promising. Even though the bgm is very good, I was just hearing the bgm from the original in my head! I do miss it... I really really really hope and pray this movie does well...",1
"There's this eccentricity in Hrithik's eyes that tells me he'll do full justice to this role. He has his own unique style, and won't be just mimicking Vijay Sethupathy. I have faith in this movie because of the makers, really looking forward to it. People just have to approach it with an open mind, rather than being so negative even before the release.",1
"The only thing that's exciting me in this film is Hrithik's portrayal of a gray shaded character. Hrithik Roshan mostly cuz the guy is just so good but in these kind of roles, it always just fascinates me to watch one of my favorite actors to perform.",1
"That Sam CS BGM towards the end gave me massive goosebumps!!!
Vishal-Shekar and Sam are gonna kill with the soundtrack!!!!!!",1
"Initially      When I heard that Hrithik Roshan is playing role of Veda ,I doubted if he could fit into that role which Vijay Sethu Pathi immortalized that Character.After watching the Teaser I am surprised and excited to see Veda in this remake version.. Congratulations to both Heroes Hrithik Roshan and ofcourse  Vikram role is tailor made for Saif ali Khan .",1
"Fully agree with you regarding that scene where Vedha (Hrithik) is smiling devilishly while spraying bullets! People have the habit of complaining ... and most of the people who are complaining, they have not even watched the Original VV. And yes, Hrithik did not copy Amitabh, and similarly here, he did not copy the Great VS!",0
"In orginal movie and trailer specifically, both Vikram and Vedha were projected to be equals. Given equal screen time, dialogues and actions. But here I believe Hrithik is being pushed more than Saif and that's what bugs me..",0
"I've just recently watched the original but I've to say that this teaser actually looks really good. I'm not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but I've high hopes from this film because it's the same duo who directed the original one. Personally, I don't have any problems from a remake and I don't think remaking something is a crime. The remake, however, has to be good. If it doesn't justify the acting of the original actors then it's a crime otherwise if it's a remake like Kabir Singh (which is a really good remake) then I don't have any problems and I feel this remake will be genuinely good",1
Let me clear you that if you are watching this song without watching movie then it's not worthy and you will not understand the reason of this song....💖Ss rajamouli..All time hit movies provider.,0
"RAM CHARAN dances sooo well
But Jr NTR debuted as protagonist when he was 18 years old
But Ram Charan came later
Both actors age is similar like RC is 37 and Jr.NTR is 39
Both are good friends off the camera as well
BTW RAM CHARAN is son of Mega star Chiranjeevi who is a very very good dancer as well
So obviously his son would dance good as well",1
Now Please react to NACHORE NACHORE song of Jr NTR yamadonga movie ( Ss Rajamouli direction ) Sensational dance moves by NTR at the age of 24 🔥 in 2007. I bet you won't regret after watching that song .,1
Each and every actor in south industry can dance so well,1
"To know ramcharan's talent you should watch ""bangaru Kodi petta"" song from magadeera movie then you will realise how he is capable of!!!",1
I think sufiyan is slowly becoming fan of NTR 😁. React to more of NTR( my suggestion is NACHORE NACHORE song from Yamadonga movie) you guys will definitely love him more.,1

"Ratsasan trailer gives more information of movie scenes except the villain scene and face thats why you were able to guess about disorder and gifts things.
But Cuttputlli trailer just gives few glimpses of Ratsasan movie and focused more on Akshay's dialogue without revealing anything thats the plus point.
Obviously Original remains classic but let's see remake works or not",1

Eminem studied the rappers that came before him and surpassed them a long time ago . That shows a genuine love for the art .You should react to brainless and bad guy from eminem . Both are fantastic songs,1
"""I'm a clown, like John Wayne gacy"" is one of my favorite things he's ever said",1
"His wordplay, metaphors, punches, and diverse flows are just syncopated genius with any beat Em The Goat Of Hip Hop Forever!🤧👊🏽🙌🏽🐐🔥🎯",1
"Please, Go for Tone Deaf, the bars are Hades itself!! Em rhymes ""Orange with Banana"" there😆. It's one of my favourites from the album",1
"The real amazing thing about Ems first few lines is that he was finishing Young MA’s rhyme scheme that she started way back in her verse. She rhymes Quavo, facial, Lay Lo, Wayne mode, drake mode, rake mode, paid so, gang mode, pain go, flame go, etc (it’s out of order I know) and then Em comes in “Game O(ever), Thanos” and finished it. The man is a monster but that was nothing but respect to Young MA for holding the rhyme scheme out that long, which I think was something she did to pay homage to Em cause that’s his style. Fire song.",1
"No one even comes close to Em. Flow cadence, story telling, accents, technicality and beats all fit for what he does.

He is the Greatest rapper by a mile and it ain't even close",1

"the hand thing that Lisa, Jennie, and Jisoo did at Rosé's part was sooooo satisfying!!!",1
"Some haters may say, ""Ah, the movements are easy peasy."" It seems they forgot that not everyone can pull out some ""easy"" movement into extravagant dance. Stage presence of YG artists never disappoint me. Blackpink killed and nailed it like always!",1
"Their CHARISMA  is  on another level  
You can really  see how much they grow  confident  since  the last  time  they  preform ❤",1
"In this dance practice, Lisa movement really sharp & crazy.. She's the main dancer and yes i love all members too.. Blackpink is the REVOLUTION!",1
"I can't wait for them to perform it on VMAS!!!!

I'm actually kinda expecting this dance practice video because literally earlier this day i checked their last comeback on how many days 'til they release their dance practice and it's only 6 days so i expected it to be released today.",1
"YG said that ""Title track is going to shake the whole world "". I'm so excited for title track.",1
"It's satisfying to watch everytime Lisa dance, it just Her Aura really blow up, she knows how to control her body, her facial expressions, the professional dancer behavior",1
I get really mesmerize when lisa is dancing. Her expression and body control is PERFECT,1
"Main dancer Lisa coming through!!! Way to go, BP. Best choreo",1

Begin is the song written by RM in Jungkook's prespective. Jungkook shared the feelings he felt with his hyungs. And RM made that into a beautiful song lyrics.,1
finally!!! I already missed you so the next one is as soon as possible 😅🤧Jungkook and Jimin are the ones who get hurt the most they always give more than they expect and often get hard on themselves and often exhaustion and fainting. just for everyone to see the best of them in every performance it hurts armys to see him this way,0
"Jungkook and Jimin are definitely the ones who push themselves the hardest during performances, they are both the ones I noticed who are getting injured or almost passing out, and its sad because when their own stage they seem so lively and full of energy and then these documentaries come out and you realize when they went back stage they were suffering. 

Jungkook has gotten injured multiple times, he's almost fainted a lot of times there was this one award show they went to and jungkooks hands were literally shaking and he fainted MULTIPLE times or came close to it....

I of course worry about all the members but I always worry the most for Jimin & JK because we KNOW how much they would put a performance and entertaining army above their health sometimes :(",0
"Guys..I'll ask again. But may you please continue and go back to the bonus content and deleted scenes you missed. I'd really like to see you to react to them as they are IMPORTANT parts of bangtans world and connected to bangtans history, shows how their emotions developed and changed over time, and give further context to a specific era /episode of the rise of bangtan. I hope you don't just brush them aside as it's really good imfomation to note as well as has all those behind the scenes you always like. Not sure why that changed but I hope you'll quickly return to them before it gets too far off. It's a helpful smooth transition between episodes as well. Because it gives you a mental break and as I said, really just gives you more and more context and content. As the series goes on they'll be more and more important to the series too. Whether that's answering questions you may have had during the episode or clarifying something that couldn't be further explored in the episode itself. You've already missed so much content. At the very least it's be nice to have a reason why you stopped all of a sudden when it's importance hasn't diminished but increased every episode..",1
"Becoming ARMY truly is a life-changing experience, and one that anyone who hasn't done any of the work to look back at their history and discography can never understand. I would have never thought that at the age of 54 I would become such a huge fan and supporter of the ""boyband"" my daughter had been a fan of for three years already at that point. 2 years later, almost to the day, and I look back and shake my head in wonder at how much of an impact that 7 young men only slightly older than my daughter have had on me. Because they have been utterly unwilling to listen to me or delve into the group themselves, they have zero understanding and they all think I'm crazy, I think. All I can think is how sad it is that they won't give them a chance and experience the same thing I have. I like the reactors who become true fans and are open to the life change that happens when they open their minds and hearts to the beauty that is BTS. You guys are that kind of reactor and it's wonderful to see.",1
"Guys is there a chapter 22 or it ended at 21 
Jungkook is really hard working and perfectionist he want to go on stage matter what happens to him 
He is turning 25 very soon 💜 he grew up 🥺",1
"Remember all the deleted and bonus episodes. A chapter is not actually over until you watch them. Maybe you didn’t know? I really like to watch you react to Rise of Bangtan, but it’s beginning to seem a bit weird to me that you don’t finish a chapter until moving on. Your reactions always seems genuine but it has made me question wether you actually want to continue this series? It’s fair id you don’t. This is just so weird, sorry",0

"Imagine this:
You wake up in a room that you've never seen before. The bed you're lying in is very comfortable. You sink right into it. You don't want to leave, but you want to know where you are. You sit up, and looking around the room, you see that it looks like you're in a very cozy, but very old room. This room has seen many, many things, it seems. There's a mirror to use, in case the person staying in the room would like to fix themselves up to look nice. There is a closet full of clothes, however you see that there is already an outfit laid out for you. If you prefer the feminine choice, it is a beautiful seafoam green dress, with a black and white striped bow and reaches just below your knees, grouped with black mary janes and long, white socks. The masculine option is a suit that consists of the same colors in the most similar areas, with black dress shoes. You put on the outfit of choice and you leave the room. You go down the stairs of the house to find two people. They look like blonde twins. One is a boy, the other is a girl. They are sipping their tea when one of them notices you. 
""Oh! You're awake!"" The boy cries. ""So they are!"" The girl replies. They introduce themselves as Aaron and Anastasia. Aaron tells you that, since you've been asleep all morning, it would be good for you to go outside with them. You reluctantly agree, but all of your worries fly out the door when you step outside. You see a field that looks like it was masterfully painted a nice mix pastel colors by the gods themselves. There are mountains in the distance, and you can also see a nice pond. In the sky, you can see the moons, and even a planet or two. You can even faintly see the stars. There are trees by the pond and one of them has a pair of swings. The three of you walk up to that tree, and you spend the rest of the day playing there, the twins took turns pushing you on the swing. Eventually, night came, and you went back to the house for dinner. Anastasia made the most delicious bread and pasta you'd ever had, and Aaron did the dishes, insisting that you relax as their guest. After a little while, you retired to your bedroom, changed into the clothes given to you, and succumbed to a calm, dreamers sleep, wondering what the next day had in store for you...",1

Last night I was watching the sun set with my cat out of my attic window and thought 'wow i'm basicly in a Lofi Girl art right now' - perfect time for a new mix! 😸💫,1
"I remember two years ago staying up at 3 in the morning with a cup of anxiety, just to listen to the 3 AM Study Session premiere at 144p using limited data on my half cracked phone, wondering where I'll be in the future and if things will go well for me after I graduate.

Now here I am once again at 3 in the morning with a cup of coffee, fast internet, and my own custom PC. It took a lot to get here and I still have a long way to go in life and have uncertainties for my future. But for anyone out there who have worries or anxieties for their next few years, just know that if I could make it, than so can you. I hope you will get to experience the same bliss I have at the moment. As we often forget to enjoy just today, when we keep thinking about the tomorrows

And thank you ChilledCow, for being there during the moments

Edit: I just want to say I appreciate everyone for all the encouraging likes and messages. I wish nothing but the best for all of you who are pulling through your struggles",0
Love it! 😃,1
"I feel like the lofi community is one of the best one out there! Its rarer than rare to find toxicity, negativity, quarrels and stuff... Theres just a bunch of people searching for inner peace while going on with life... 

I am extremely fortunate to find this community at an early age (or thats what i think so) 
Hope this community lives forever!

Checklist: 

• A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate💧

• Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time🔋

• Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone🎧

• a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.☕

• Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.⌨

•Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 🐈


Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 
You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book. (´▽`ʃ♡ƪ)

I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight 😴🧸

This innocent love, the butterflies in your stomach and the late night giggles on the phone. I really miss being this young and stress free. I always dreamt about being older, having a good job, a great man on my side and just being happy with life. 

I am now 23 and life did not come out as i expected. However, i wouldn't want to miss out on a single day. I am still excited for what is about to come. Hopefully i will find the love i deserve, the peace i need and the happiness i want. 🥺❤️",1

"Things to help you study:

Water: did you know you can only survive a couple days with out it? Also it can help you concentrate
Lofi music: why not? It helps!!
burning incense: OMG, it just puts you in zone!!
Snacks- I find it hard to study on an empty stomach.
Breaks: Breaks are very important if you want to stay concentrated, and if you stretch out your back, you may be lucky and get a few good back cracks!
sleep: Sleep well at night!!!
Comfy space: Make your study space as comfy as possible! (just not to much so you will fall asleep!!)
TURN OFF YOUR PHONE (Unless all you are doing is work/studying and lofi girl music)
Also open up a window, its great for fresh air!!
And lastly your study stuff!!
Now go and study and stop looking at comments!! 
Hope you have a great study time! I know you are woking hard. Be proud of your self. Don't let anyone put you down!! You are strong. You can do this!! I am proud of you!! <3",1

"If you come here because you need that little bit of peace, let me tell you please don't give up.
 You have to keep fighting.
 That stronger, faster, better you is waiting at the end of whatever battle you're fighting. 
It's not the end.
 It's only the beginning. 
You have to get up
. Despite the numerous times you've been slammed into the ground you have to dust yourself off and ask ""is that all you got?"" Because you're strong. 
Know it. Own it. 
Trust me, I know. 
And if you have to go down, go down fighting with everything you've got. Never stop fighting. 
Please.
 I'm sure someday we will meet and show our battle scars and talk about how we made it. 
Sleep easy tonight.
 You need to rest. 
Blessings and Love❤❤❤",1

sometimes, before studying, you need to remind yourself what you're doing this for.

you'll get there
you can do it.
let's try to make it together, eh?  *smiles and offers you a hand*
 

fix your posture,
unclench your jaw,
relax your muscles,
breath in,
..... and breath out.
repeat with me; 
""I got this!""

Damn right! you HAVE got this. believe in yourself <3

Now, let's get studying!

don't forget to drink water!",1

You got this!",1
"Life hits hard. It hits everybody again and again, like tides against the shore. Get up. Another wave is coming, but thats just fine because you are strong. Get up. I know you fell down before, and that's just fine. Get up. You're going to keep falling down, of course you are, that's all the more reason to get up again, because that's what you're made of. You are not being measured by how tall you can stand, but by how many times you can get up before you give up. Run until your legs give out, swim until you drown, climb until you fall, life is short. Endure the agony that comes because it can't last. Why not see just how far you can go? I believe in you. Im running too. Im climbing too. Im swimming until I can't anymore. I refuse to drown. Stay here with me, be my brother, be my sister. We will fight for each other.",1

Today wasn’t a good day for me mentally! I came here to find a way to heal and to smile. Reading the comments have helped me a lot. I love the positivity and the community here.  - Thank you 🙏🏽,1
"It's been a hard year, this was really nice to chill to while scrolling through some motivational quotes to get my going :)
reminder: if you are someone like me; someone who is kind of a perfectionist, or if u think ur life isn't ""good enough"" or ""messy""
here's some motivation: life is supposed to be messy, that's what makes life, 'life'. ""the way I see it if you want to see the rainbow you've got to put up with the rain"" -unknown. life is basically an adventure, there and ups and downs and smooth roads. won't it be boring if your life went EXACTLY the way you wanted it? the hard times are an experience, and the present time is a moment to appreciate.
so let's appreciate this beautiful life together, whatever you are going through, you will get through it. The rainbow will be across your head at the right time

"MAY 18, 2022 - 58 YEARS AGO (in 1964), The Animals recorded House of the Rising Sun at De Lane Lea Studios, Kingsway, London. Happy Anniversary and thanks to The Animals for their great version of this song and musical gifts to the world. Please give them a BIG THUMBS UP! 👍 🎶⭐",1
"Great song, great singer and great band. Thank you for the upload 🌻❤🙏",1
"Musicians play simple instruments, no show, no expensive costumes, no expensive lighting effects, only youth and talent and it turned out to be a masterpiece.",1
"This dude has the most amazing set of pipes, his voice can echo through literal decades.",1
"Im leaving my comment here so when someone likes it, I can listen to this masterpiece again.",1
"I’ve been looking for this song for age’s, and I finally found it. And this is still a masterpiece.",1
What a heroic defense of her cubs made the cougar mom. Loved it!,1
“All he could do is look on humiliated as the victor claims his reward”… 😂 he was stuck on the side of his shell looking helpless.,0
"And the mother cougar is so much smaller than some of the massive male cougars , that was amazing.",1
I love this so much please do a part two! I can watch this all day,1
I love watching these clips! They really show you how powerful these animals really are!,1
Lol the tortoise segment was pure gold. Bro shot the fade and flipped him over helplessly. Then proceeded to clap tortoise cheeks and made em watch ☠️,1
I can’t believe they just showed that tortoise hitting it from the back like that 🤣🤣,0
The turtle segment is hilarious😂,1
"the arsenal of weaponry, the tactics, the engagement pressed by an urgency, the primal intent to disable ... like you don't play boxing, nature don't play. there is much to learn within these segments, very much to learn",0
This song on full volume will result in either a speeding ticket or a pregnancy.  Or both.,0
2021 and this song still at the top of my list. The good music never dies,1
"12 years later and I still love this song. Give Nickelback all the undeserved hate you want, I think they're good.",1
This song should be listened while driving at full speed....LOVE THIS SONG........:),1
I never understood Nickleback hate.  I love the dirty growl of their guitars and his rough voice.,1
Never understood the Nickelback hate. They were always really good imo.,1
I grew up listening to Nickelback. I actively like them. My parents have literally seen them live over 5 times.... like come on.,1
"God I love this song so much it never understood the hate this band gets! The guitar, the voice and drums just rule!!!",1
"i have been listening to nickelback since i was 9yrs old this was the first song i heard and i still love them so much !!! ( im 21yrs old now ) my first concert ever was nickelback, 18 nov 2014 ziggo dome Amsterdam. i really don't get why some people hate them :( they are amazing <3 <3 @nickelback",1
"Say what you want about nickel back, I was never a giant fan but the drums and bass in this song are top tier. Great song.",1
"Loved the setting sun art. Well done, and just beautiful. Thanks.",1
Very adorable Video. Enjoyed it. !,1
Beautiful😍,1
"Adorable animals, Thank you for sharing 👍🏻",1
"2.8.2022.First class,excellent and marvelous.I am awaiting more videos like this.Thanks and God bless you with good health.",1
Every animal is beautiful. Zebras are my favorite animal and they are more beautiful than any other animal 🦓🦓❤❤,1
Amazing footage !!!.,1
"Great!.... I really like this video.
Every animal is interesting and amazing!",1
The world of wildlife is diverse and rich. Many rare animals need to be preserved. Good and relaxing music. Thanks for this video. 🥰😀💝🙏,1
thanks for all the support!,1
Dude's beating those drums like they owe him money.,0
Listening to this whole album makes you 150% stronger in the gym,1
"Different, but i like it, Architects never disappoint",1
"If you're still listening to this masterpiece, you've a good taste in music.

Architects never let me down.",1
"Just found you guys after being recommend by a friend of mine. He says "" you have to hear this song"". After Listening to this on repeat for an hour i then found the album. That is great from cover to cover! You guys are what this genre needs badly!!!! You guys are tearin it up..much respect.",1
This is truly a masterpiece man. I love the blend with the clean vocals and the very catchy chorus.,1
This song makes me want to agree to the terms and services without reading them.,1
"I actually like the fact that every Maroon 5 is different from one another, it makes them special. They are a band that always keeps moving and doesn't get stuck in any sort of rut.",1
"Hidden meaning aside, this song is a banger",1
"The greatest music of all time !! never get bored of listening to it, it'd been 7 years.",1
"I used to love this as a kid, I still love it bc its so addicting",1
"Quase uma década dessa música, estou envelhecendo 😳❤️",1
"I’m gonna say it. If you knew this song’s actual meaning before you were 12, your either lying or lost your innocence too early. In which case, rip you my guy",0
"I saw a silver fox once. I was four-wheeling with my grandpa while he was out moose hunting. And it ran right in front of us, and it didn’t even seem scared. They are absolutely gorgeous in person, pictures don’t do them justice 😍",1
"That white lobster looks like its shell is made of opals, and in most pictures here, the Akhal-Teke Horse's fur to me looked more pearlescent than golden.
Truely stunning looking creatures, one and all of them.",1
I've seen a completely white peacock at a fair once. It was beautiful and very friendly! We weren't allowed to touch him but they would walk around in an area and be very comfortable around people,1
I've seen a blue lobster at an aquarium once. Pretty neat and very different from a standard lobster.,1
"The music is so relaxing and seeing all of these amazing beings has made my day a whole lot better. We certainly do need to protect all of them, because Earth would be terrible without any of them being around. Thank you for this video.",1
"Oh WOW great sounds and impressive pictures 😍 so great to just switch off, relax and escape from everyday life. Should really be done regularly. Thank you - great work and all the best ❤️🙏☺️",1
"Great! This is one of the most wild, raw videos I have ever seen.  Beautiful animals,  spectacular scenery, amazing music.",1
Great filming! Beautiful and spectacular scenery and music. But above all wonderful animals.,1
"Nature is our key ally, we need to re-connect with nature, protect and restore it…because the sad truth is: almost all the stunning animals in this video are disappearing at an alarming rate. 
But these videos do help with sharing the message and showing how beautiful and important nature and biodiversity is 🙌🏻🌍✅",1
"This is probably the best video on a channel that is already full of videos that are incredibly beautiful. 

The quality of the footage is in its own league, possibly the highest quality you can find on YouTube. I am so glad that I found this gem. And I’m sorry for people who don’t know this channel. I hope there will be many more videos showing the beauty of many more places on this planet. 

These videos give people the chance to see the world. And the only thing they need is an internet connection. You bring joy to people all over the world. It’s simply fantastic. Thank you so much.",1
Amazing nature and wildlife on earth!,1
This is absolutely stunning. I love the voice over. There is always something special about watching nature and animals.,1
"Documentaries of all kinds literally never fail to keep me intrigued, especially animal, crime, or history ones.",1
I absolutely love nature😍it just calming to me n watching the behavior of all the animals is very fascinating,1
"This was absolutely incredible- the beautiful area, where so many are nourished, the wonderful narration and the exquisite music- what a wonderful combination plus the positivity of the focus that they will have all they need- thank-you so much for doing this- may be the best documentary I've ever seen.",1
beautifully done !! without any animal hunting actions for a change . very soothing,1
Great documentary! Very peaceful and relaxing.,1
These documentaries are always so relaxing...love 'em,1
I love nature and this wild life video make me feel good when watching and learning about the survival of the wild animals ❤badly I feel simpathicaly for an elephant tunk..but am grand it's strong and still using it...thank alot for the video 🙏🙌,1
I love nature documentaries about the lesser known parts of the world such interesting diversity and beauty,1
"I appreciated this nature video so much, especially because it did not show any killing.  Except for the butterflies.",1
"Not only were all four members of Pink Floyd phenomenal musicians and songwriters, they were fortunate enough to have some great engineering and production folks to assist them in delivering music that will never die. I cannot recall just how many times I spent in my bedroom with my headphones on just blissfully absorbed by Animals. Didn’t need shrooms or acid to trip to this masterpiece.",1
This album is 45 year old today and still an absolute banger.,1
This could have been released today and it _still_ would sound futuristic.,1
It’s hard to estimate how many times I’ve listened to this album…it doesn’t really matter but I bought the vinyl in 1977…I was 15 and here it is 01/31/2022 and it’s as fresh as the first time I listened❤️,1
One of the best albums ever made. Timeless,1
"Just a complete kick in the gut every time I hear it. *Such* a good album, but goddamn dark AF. Truly a masterwork.",1
Приятного просмотра! Happy viewing! 😺🐶,1
👍❤️🔥Спасибо за смешную подборку о животных! Смеялась от души! ❤️❤️❤️,1
I think baby elephants and lion cubs deserved an honorable mention,1
"It was around the summer of 1974 when a friend and I went to the Fresno Zoo. As we approached the hippo area we could see one in the water. We watched it for a little while then started to walk away when suddenly this little baby hippo head broke the surface of the water. Needless to say, we were captivated by this tiny baby hippo that was frolicking in the water around its mother. We could hardly tear our eyes away from the delightful sight. Later that night  the local news show had a report about the new baby hippo that had just been born at the Zoo that day. That baby hippo was one of the most adorable baby animals I've ever seen!",1
"I couldn't stop smiling throughout the entire video and my heart just glowed with an aura of golden love! Thank you so much for making our day brighter by showing all these adorable little darlings. If I could, I'd adopt one of each. I hope that we humans will                                                                                                                                                                                                  work together to save all these species and treat them with love. I am so grateful that I was blessed with 7 kitties and one dog throughout my life, they were truly a gift from God! Many good wishes to you and all viewers.",1
"Baby elephants are also adorable, I thought it would have been included",1
My eyes are melting from the cuteness 🤩🤩🤩😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍,1
I don’t have a favorite because they are all so darn cute!,1
Baby cheetahs are actually really cute with their little mohawk looking furs i think so at least,1
The red panda just makes me die from cuteness!!!💕❤️,1
"Everything’s adorable here but it bugs me that there are animals included that look similar but aren’t the animal listed. Ex: sloth bear in with the sloth; chipmunk mixed in with squirrels, and so on.  Still all super cute.",1
Cuteness overload ❤❤❤,1
"My family actually saw a moose around that size, it was insane!",1
"The alligator at 1:55 is oh my god!!! Extremely huge and tall, that was very surprising to me",1
This man is amazing because he talks on best fact,1
"8:41 I have seen one of those big spiders in my bathroom when my sister was just about to take a bath, the spider was just hanging on the corner of our wall :((((((",0
"“As a rule, fight’s between two rhinos don’t even end with injuries” pretty certain that rhino fights have the highest mortality rate of any mammal other than humans.",0
"""I can't Even imagine what the poor warthog had gone through"" 

The air, Mr narrator...the air",0
"The best part of this video is you getting the names of animals wrong. The ""goat"" in the second clip made me roar.",1
"The African leopard is the worst case scenario for humans. A complete predator which intermediates between lions and cheetahs. Swift, stealth, agile and resentful. You can run and climb but you can't hide!",0
"Well made , informative and entertaining! Ty for including imperial measurements , I wish all makers would do the same !",1
It's nice to observe the wild animals fighting each other 👍👍👍❤️,1
"I love how everybody comments on how he gets the names wrong, LOL",1
"Also I think what you call ""shapeshifter is a newly discovered type of squid, the lights are possible for a sea creature as we see deep water has lights, well it's no underwater electricity but it's something!",1
"For the megalodon vs whale, I think that the creature that just scooped up the whale it NOT a shark. It doesn't seem like a normal attack of a shark",0
"The so-called “turtle snake” @10:24 is a hoax. The only thing real was the (blurred out) fish guts, the rest was said most likely to be cardboard and/or papier-mâché.",0
2:13 that poor kid still being scared even tho the shark is dead,0
The crocodile was terrifying 😨,0
"I believe that New England had it's own giant hornets this summer. I know because I was cleaning my kitchen, and saw two very big hornets, huge, and scary! It's even scarier for me because I'm allergic to stings",0
This song is everything. Will never stop listening to this.,1
"I was 8 when this came out. I was always a curious optimistic kid in elementary school looking forward to the next day. I’m turning 20 in a few months. Currently in my second year in college, and getting ready to follow my dad’s/my own footsteps in my job. I miss the minimal responsibility, but we must keep moving forward.",1
"This song feels like falling into best-friendship with someone, like not a romantic love but someone you're close to platonically and have grown close to and realizing you never want to leave",1
"This video is 10 years old now, when it came out I was a 17 year old who was confused. Now I’m 27 with a wife, a great job and a new born and I’ve never been happier. Man time flies",1
"Lyrics

Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid
You're never satisfied

Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
You're just
A cannibal
And I'm afraid
I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide

I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Hush, hush, the world is quiet
Hush, hush, we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Whoa, I won't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tonight

Here we go again [3x]

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting?

Here we go again, oh, oh [3x]
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight",0
I accidentally click this song on Spotify and I really love it,1
"I'm a late 2000's early 2010's kid, and neon trees brings back so many memory's.",1
"This is a happy video that relieves stress from the comfortable and beautiful sounds of nature, the beautiful grass wind, and even the smell of flowers.  Thanks for uploading. Be healthy and happy today.",1
*The little animals are so cute and adorable. A meaningful and relaxing video. Thanks for sharing.*,1
"Cute, darling baby animals:-) Very enjoyable!",1
Beautiful,1
So cutee. Loved it!!!❤❤❤,1
Thank you for this wonderfully relaxing piano music with natural sounds in the background.🙏🌳 I was able to sleep very relaxed and deeply.❤❤,1
Cutest video ever!  Thanks!,1
Beautiful,1
Very nice Video. Enjoyed it. .,1
so nice I like your channel 💚💚💚💚,1
That dog that stopped the truck for its owner who was having a seizure is nothing short of incredible.,1
You know we’ve fallen short as a species when animals have to remind us how to show unconditional love for one another,0
That stray dog helping that lady had me in tears. He is a keeper. I wish he finds himself the family he deserves. That dog right there was a real life hero❤️ protected a complete stranger as if his own master🥹,1
"It warms my heart to see animals trying to save other animals, even a small fish, where a human would have left it to die. Animals are so much smarter than we think, they know things even we do not. Animals care way more than humans do. They are not greedy but only take what they need and help others to survive, even ones that are not of its own kind. That is the true way to live in this world. Animals deserve so much more kindness than we give them. Next time you see a animal, give it the respect and kindness it deserves.",1
In my experience pets have demonstrated more humanity than humans ever did. Love the vid!  :),1
"I fell out of tree once when I was young, and it knocked the wind out of me really bad. My German Shepard ran up and grabbed my shirt and started pulling me to my back porch. He was a good boy!",1
"Animals are way more awesome and sensitive souls, and more intelligent than most people give them credit for. This was amazing!💖🐾😊",1
That dog helping his disabled owner is a beautiful being. I love animals,1
Mass respect to all these animals 💯,1
"CUTE animals ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ LOVE your videos, SUPER LIKE as always, a big kiss from mini yorkie Yoshi, au au au 🐶🐶🐶",1
Cute  😍,1
Wahh😍trbaikk👍👍,1
Wow,1
Hewan good 👍👍,1
Nice 😘,1
Good  #Animals Fun All,1
When the husky was screaming mama I laughed so hard,1
The dog jumping off the slide was a tad traumatic for me. 😳,0
A few are funny but some are cruel. Pets being teased till they retaliate is not good either.,0
"the bird was like ""yeah the view isn't as great but flying down here is so much easier and relaxing""",1
"0:46 he looks just like Scooby-Doo!

Totally forgot how to do time stamps..",1
I love baby😍😍🐈‍⬛🐈🥰🥰🦮♥️🐕‍🦺💕😘,1
1:56 I had to go to the hospital after seeing that one😂,0
"After reading comments I agree I felt ripped off, so I decided to search for ""fattest giraffe"" and there are many copies of that particular photo, with a few that have been squished or spread to make it look even fatter. Yet there was also one sitting in someones hand. Suspicious I know.  But I was more amazed to find a very overweight tiger, one animal I would not expect to get fat. Also huge prairie dog. and a very fat horse. Some animals labelled morbidly obese could turn up more.",0
It's so sad to see the ones that were truly loved by their elderly owners. They never meant to harm their fur babies.,0
"I wish they had more footage on Deep Blue. There are only two videos of her that I know about. That original one, and the one where they saw her off the coast of Hawaii. Just watching her swim around impresses me, she is huge.",1
"1:48 ""Even though they might look happy, they most certainly aren't""..... 
That Hedgehog is living his best life, gets to eat all day and gets plenty of attention.",1
I'm Aussie and the way he said kukaburra had me laughing so hard I fell of my bed,1
"I went to the State Fair in Dallas, Texas and there was a Pig, weighted 1400 pounds, they turned him every half hour. And big Red cows, some with their babies. It was so interesting.",1
Can we just appreciate how Oshine picked up the toy after she fell off XD,1
This song hits different now that I'm listening to this on a late night in the middle of June,1
To be real when I first heard this song I immediately love it. And honestly the vibe is great as well. 🥰😍🥰☺️,1
Am I the only one to who this song makes me feel an indescribable feeling? Feels kinda nostalgic btw…,1
I feel my mind calm down and i foget everything and vibe to the song.DONT LET THIS SONG DIE,1
Este tema le encanta a mi nene de 7 años 🤗❣️🇦🇷,1
Dave dancing to the empty theater just makes me wanna cry,0
umas das melhores musicas sem duvidas!❤,1
"The song makes you remember nostalgic things when the song itself isn’t nostalgic. It’s a normal box of nostalgia, when it becomes older, it becomes nostalgia. A box of nostalgia. the box is made out of nostalgia. what a amazing song",1
This song still Gives goosebumps  even after 2years,1
Started hearing this song on the radio literally everyday I really like this record,1
I love your animals and your content,1
It’s awesome to see how far your zoo has come! It looks amazing but I think your macaws would be a lot happier in a larger enclosure,1
They will be so happy with you so cool I appreciate you being so awesome to the animals you take such good care of them😀❤🧡,1
"Hey Jacob, your animals are absolutely beautiful and precious  . You do a fantastic job in caring and loving them.  Keep up the amazing work and videos.  They are truly amazing.",1
I love your animals soooooo much,1
All your Animal are cute 🙏😍☺️,1
"That’s so cool, thank you for making videos. I love your vids",1
Great episode buddy !! Finally a full zoo tour !!,1
You are awsome keep up the good work I watch you everyday,1
One of my favorite sites to visit....love it and thank you for such an informational site on wildlife!!!,1
In my imagination's I thought I could out run a wild animal....but damn 60km/hr for a hyena!! I would be dead in secs,0
"Largest known animal on earth...blue whale
Best sea predator...orca
A cheetah is not a leopard...
Otherwise, good vid",1
The camera people  deserve our appreciation. 👍💪✌️,1
These animals are cool and interesting over last summer in upstate NY I've been seeing alot of endangered species returning up in lake minawaska I saw a few bald eagles last summer,1
"Okay that's thumbnail is really cool, now that would be something I would absolutely love to see on video.",1
We wish you all the very best for your future life. May everything that you do make you happy and rise,1
I love your videos. Keep going.you are great.😀😀😀,1
"Don't care what anyone says, an orchestra puts so much more oomph and power behind a song like this.. Now it's on a completely different level 🥵",1
"The orchestra looks like they are enjoying it, and that makes me really happy.",1
"Whoever arranged the orchestral parts is brilliant. Instead of the usual treatment of trying to fit the song into an orchestral piece, they fit the orchestra to the song. This has got to be one of the best, if not the best, orchestral versions of a hard rock/metal song I've seen.",1
I’m a violinist in an orchestra and I listen to Architects. This is like the best thing ever happened in my life,1
This needs to be on Spotify ASAP,1
Now this is some fucking awesome music - Amazing!,1
This needs to be on Spotify. Now please. The people have spoken. Goosebumps,1
"""He could break right through that glass, leave it alone!""
""I have a gun""
Most Floridian thing i've ever heard",0
I love how the puma and the human are basically yelling the same shit at each other.,0
"“Well there goes the end of my tarp fishing”

Calmly tells a big ass croc/gator to “get back” 😂😂",0
"I have encountered bears while hiking  in Alaska (photographed the 🐻  in my pic), but the mountain lion clips actually  freaked me out the most.",0
That shirtless guy nearly gave me a heart attack when the snake was coming and he was leaving the baby and so slow getting in the house to close the door if it wasn’t for the other guy who did everything faster it was going to end bad,0
I like how the cyclist immediately surrendered to the moose.,1
7:03 One of the most scariest encounters ever,0
“Oh my god guys! There’s an octopus eating a crab!!” Then watches it like a action movie💀,0
The bear chase at 0:45 is unforgivable. A real shame the bear missed.,0
Você é muito criativa parabéns 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻,1
I'm thinking of wolf demons when I hear this song this means it's super good.,1
This is the best song ever I'm so glad you made it in gacha,1
Me remembering this months later xD its still gud,1
Amei 😍,1
I like how you included the parents in the background when she howls 🙂,1
I love this song ❤️,1
I LOVE THIS I SUBED AND THIS IS AMAZING,1
Amazing!!,1
This is absolutely stunning. I love the voice over. There is always something special about watching nature and animals.,1
"Love this documentary so much! The narrator is amazing, also let's not forget the writer Andy Mitchell! Thank you for making this available for free!",1
"Fantastic documentary ! Hope we as humans preserve all of the species, and for that matter, all animal/plant life for generations to come. Snow Leopards are just astonishing !",1
"This is 1000 times better than any movie.
Thanks so much.
Love to the production management💕",1
I can actually feel what's shown here without actually being there in the wild. Beautiful creatures and masterfully lensed.,1
I love the goose noises coming from the crow at 13:01 and the horse noises for the zebras. Totally accurate!,1
"There is a big mistake in this. The dazzle camouflage doesn't work to hide the zebra in the grass, it's designed to make it difficult to judge distance to a target. So when the lion goes to attack the zebra he might pounce too soon, and when he is in the chase he will find it difficult when to strike out with his claws. The same thing was used against submarines.",0
"is this original footage? or from somewhere else? regardless, it looks freakin fantastic! the editing is superb.",1
"Just finished watching....wonderful episode! Brilliant subject matter, relaxing, intriguing music, exquisite cinematography, & Lee Perry has such a commanding presence as narrator, yet calm & serene ...Animal Armory series has quickly become my new favorite! 
Thnx so much for this lovely program! Perfect for rainy day in NY.
🐎🐸🐙🐧🐻 🐆",1
its good and funny to see how animals cares for each other specially the goat and the chickens.,1
That giraffe was pretty amazing body slamming then stomping with such precision.  I had no idea  they could defend themselves like that!.,1
The way that raccoon got flung had me dying lmao.,0
Incredible vid. We all possess the inherent right of self-defense. The bees’ revenge on the hornet was masterful.,1
3:39 love how the female cutely flops away,1
I really love how the frog scapes from the snake 😂😂😂😂,1
THE WAY HE USED A FRYING PAN SHOWED ME HOW POWERFUL I WOULD BE WITH IT 😃😂,1
4:37 That actually got my belly broken XD,0
"The favorite for me was when the goat who had nothing to do with the fight, seemingly went over to defend the chicken from the hawk!",1
"Wow, so cute!!! Congrats! Love from Romania 🤗😁😂👏👏👏♥️",1
Thank you for bringing joy to all of us with your work! God bless you 🙏 ❤️,1
Thanks for sharing cutest ever❤️,1
I Love it so much it's so cute 🥰🥰🥰💞💞😘😘❤️❤️❤️🌷🌷,1
🤗😇😇😇❤❤❤❤❤❤,1
The animals are so cute,1
"So cute..
Love from Pakistan.. Happy day to all of you",1
🐶😹😻💗,1
I have a huge...HUGE rat-phobia...so I know i don't wanna encounter an Albino rat the size of a small fully grown dog...the sight alone will most probably kill me.,0
Love the videos. But surprised you didn’t mention polar bear or shark whale?,1
"I love animal videos, but this one has some flat out incorrect information. Elephants for example do not find humans ""cute"". Spreading that kind of information is what leads people to underestimating an animal and getting themselves hurt. Wild animals are just that - wild. They can be socialized, but that does not mean tame or domesticated.",0
Thanks for another great vid so interesting but damn I'm so glad there's a screen between me and most of these animals,1
"I have video footage of a elk ripping the front of my brother in laws pick up truck apart. He was pissed of at my brother in law because he made the sound of a male. That thing was 200 yards away when he did that and let me tell you I felt like I barely made into the truck in time that was only 15 feet from us. I've never seen such power in real life, it was insane. That was on Vancouver Island just for your info.",0
very interesting video. But according to Wikipedia great white sharks have bite force 4000 lbs you said 1300lbs I believe. so which is accurate?,1
"I just finished college, all these years of schooling have been mostly miserable. 

Now I spend a lot of time learning things on youtube for fun and out of curiosity.",0
"I often watch this Ted Talk when needing extra encouragement as a home educator. May you Rest In Peace, Sir Ken Robinson. Thank you for sharing your wisdom.",1
The sad thing is this was posted 7 years ago and nothing has changed in the school system.,0
"Who is here after learning about his passing? 😭

Rest in peace, dear sir. Rest in peace. You've inspired many including myself, and we'll do our best to continue carrying your torch.",1
It wasn't until I left school that I discovered how interesting learning can be - including what in school I found tedious.,1
This man made more sense in 20 minutes than a whole 'committee' in years and years of 'planning' and 'execution'.,1
This is why field trips are soooo good. They create an atmosphere of curiosity and learning. Its sad how in high school we get much less.,1
And that is why I have learnt much more on YouTube than in school.,1
You forgot the most important function of school:  To make children hate learning.,0

"I love that as  part of additional recourses for our sociology class we have these videos. It is also funny how our teacher is always warning us that it's focused a lot on american context. :D Which is true, because from this video it looks like USA has one of the best educational systems, which is deffinetly not true. Here in the Czech Republic compulsory school attendance functions since 1774. Also our entire educational system is free and there is no religon in most schools (public or private). Of course there are many countries that have worse educational system than USA, but I don't think you have the best one. But it's just my opinion, so please don't come at me... :D",1
"Educational institutions usually leads to an enrichment of ideas and a chance to gain an upper hand in terms of either gaining higher degrees or being more effective in your current job. Though there is inequality in terms of learning acquisition (neighborhood, preconceptions of people, and income) which affects HOW much of the education will actually be grasped by the pupil (student). It’s fascinating seeing how societies construct various institutions for the given populace to work around in. Loved the references you used as well!

- James",1
Pleaseeee do these for UK sociological structures because most of your videos have helped my alevels so far and are incredibly helpful,1
"We are teaching our children the wrong things in school. We are creating a societal system where each section is dependent upon the other sections. This means when one section fails then the rest also fail. 

We need to teach our children to be independent.  Instead, we teach children how to be obedient workers.

To give meaning to someone's life teach them how to grow their own food, build their own house, repair their own car, cook their own meals, eat to stay healthy and most importantly how to meditate and pray. This gives life meaning.",0
Interesting. My learning style is: slow.,1
"My grade 8 science project, back in the late 80's, was on learning styles. My teacher was shocked and surprised when I submitted my project idea. All my subjects were my classmates. Over a span of a couple weeks I tested their comprehension of certain short stories, pictures, and videos; through visual, audio, and reading. When the science fair day came, my booth wasn't the most popular with any of the other kids, but with all the school teachers and parents... they loved it. I remember the results of my project was inconclusive because I tested each student individually with each individual method of learning. No one method of learning is better than another, but combining multiple methods of learning is where results would be seen. But I ran out of time to combine methods of learning before the project was due.",1
"I worked as a high school teacher for thirty years. Over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories, which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory. Learning style was just one of many. Nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced. Nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories (presented as facts) demanding evidence and proof. Ever. Yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher. So you had no choice. At least whilst being observed!! I became quite cynical in the end because I realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their CV. And each method would last a year or two before going out of fashion and being replaced by a new one. God forbid anyone would actually just leave the teachers to use their own experience, education and intelligence.",0
"I had an excellent, and very intense mathematical statistics professor for whom varying teaching style *WAS* his teaching style. I recall, one day for an hour long lecture, he came in and wrote notes and provided examples and proofs, and he never said a single word. In another day, he switched his handwriting to beautiful, perfect cursive. He was a bizarre teacher, but pushed me to the absolute limit. Great prof!",1
"I’ve been self-studying A-Level Maths for the last two years and I think the real method to learning in my own experience is ‘repetition’. Similar to how you would work out in a gym, the more you do it the better you become at it.

I think I’ve taught myself more in the last two years than any of my teachers ever did in school.",1
"i'm a pressure learner, i only learn school material when there's severe stress and doubts about my future imposed on me",0
"People learn easier when they are interested and is enjoying to know a topic. Also, if you understand schooling, as the obligation of attend to school and have satisfying grades, and education, as acquire knowledge through studying for self interest, it will not only be clearer that we learn only what we want to know, but also, that several government regulations on schools around the globe is actually, making people dumber.",0
"I'm a teacher in New Zealand and VARK was covered in my teaching degree 17 years ago. We did questionaires to determine the order of our preferences, but we were told to try and cover all these aspects in our teaching, ie try and give the children a verbal aspect, and an auditory aspect, and a reading aspect, and a kinaesthetic aspect. That sounds more like the multi-modal approach you described. I remember I came home very excited about it and suggested to my wife that she do the questionnaire as well. She looked at it and said ""I don't want to read all that, can't you read it to me?""",1
"I feel like the ""learning styles"" myth has ultimately HELPED teaching, though.  It's encouraged teachers to be more multimodal in their TEACHING style in order to (in their minds) reach a wider variety of learners.  Even if the hypothesis was wrong, it's ultimately created a stronger teaching style.",1
"Twenty years ago I gave a small talk about VARK to my fellow educators. The key point in my plenary was that learning styles are not separate, but complement each other in a holistic manner. Over 47 years I have found many 'keys' to assisting students to learn : humour, comfort (having eaten, slept well, etc.) pause frequently to review points, question your own knowledge openly and invite students to do the same as they learn. I loved teaching and was only persuaded to finish when the paperwork before AND after took more time than the educating.",1
I'm glad I live in the age of the internet. I learn every day. I've never stopped being a student.,1
"It's official. I'm opening a school like this if I'm rich when I'm older. Or maybe even if I'm poor. I really don't care, I just want a school like this.",1
"I personally believe children and students should be taught to think for themselves. They should learn to debate, solve problems and be encouraged",1
This video speaks to my soul! I'm training to be a teacher at the moment and it's not what I imagined. I don't feel like it's what I should do with my life but this video has revived me slightly and reminded me that this was/is my vision and not to be bogged down by the current system. Awesome videos!,1
"Every single one of these videos is perfectly made, with amazing points. Everything is so well thought out! These videos make the world a better place.",1
"I am a teacher. I love my job and I need to tell you this is happening in schools. It is pushed for students to learn and understand life problems. We call it the ""hidden curriculum"". It is what teachers facilitate in their classrooms. Teachers put students in many situations and help guide them in appropriate ways. Or guidance about finding themselves and their interests. Or understanding money (which is definitely in the curriculum). You are correct it is NOT as blatant as this example and I wish it were more but your next video I would love to see your solution to this problem. The education system knows this is where we want to go. They just don't know how.",1
"It's official. I'm opening a school like this if I'm rich when I'm older. Or maybe even if I'm poor. I really don't care, I just want a school like this.",1
Great video. I look forward to teaching my children these valuable lessons if the current curriculum doesn't go over these important subjects.,1
"Schools definitely needs to teach the various biases and fallacies. Funny thing about them is that by simply knowing, people will commit much less of them. This is one of the purest example of ""knowledge is power"" and most certainly belongs in a curriculum.",1
"Great work! #The School of Life
It's really heart warming that you made an effort to study the current education system and provided with a simple solution like focusing on the life challenging subjects, having said that, I don't want this to be just anther video, I want us all to collaborate and design a real time working ed. system, test and work on it at small scale first then making it bigger(later), because i don't want the future and the current generation to suffer the same fate as we did.
Peace.<3",1
"As someone who grew up doing Common Core—

It just took time away from learning things that were actually useful in class, it frustrated the teachers attempting to teach it, and it cost the school a lot of money to get all the printed math books and other Common Core materials for essentially no benefit to the students.

I can’t recall a single time Common Core was spoken of positively by the teachers or the other students.",0
"So we found that the problem wasn’t the education system per se but the circumstances that children grew up in. And rather than even entertain the possibility that an inequitable socioeconomic foundation was to blame, it was easier to say “kids aren’t learning because there’s something wrong with the books, teachers, and schools.” I love how simple it is to explain so many crappy circumstances through the lens of cognitive dissonance. Now we’ve graduated to blaming lack of homeownership on people being too indebted as opposed to a dearth of housing options in the places where people actually want to live (or more accurately a dearth of places with housing where people actually want to live.)",0
"I dropped out of high school when i was held back in 11th grade, and got my GED at 2 weeks before my 19th birthday, the GED tests were way easier than end of the year tests in regular school",1
Schools need to push to hold back students instead of pushing them to a level out of their league until they give up. The students that are showing much slower growth need to be put into an alternative career/life focused school/classes/program.,0
"Let's perform it on a positive note. The culture and ecology have to be healthy for starters. Schools have to be safe and secure. It has to be supportive of learning curve for the students. The student must take extreme ownership of the curricula. The subject matters must be based on science. Learning methods must be evidence-based. (Yes, I'm a seasoned STEM teacher by the way).",1
"Apologies for not watching the whole video.  As a former student and a parent of students, I know the system was broken long before common core.  I remember in college, my English 1 teacher had to give me a grammar guide, because I was so deficient on the basics--though I did well in English all through school.  I had to take remedial math, because my high school didn't prepare me for college courses--though I graduated with the required credits.  

Things have gone down since I was a student, and my kids had schools with very high standards, but very low expectations.  That means there were a lot of advanced classes offered--like calculus--but so many ways to accept failure.  They had to take history and social studies, but only had to PASS one!  The policy of ""No Child Left Behind"" was an additional failure, as it meant no one failed or was held back, even though they wouldn't graduate on time.  Kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted.  

Too much government involvement means teachers aren't allowed to TEACH!  We have some phenomenal teachers, who are underpaid, with far too much non-teaching responsibility heaped on them.  Schools aren't just expected to educate students.  Now, they've got to feed them, clothe them, teach them manners and how to get along, look out for abuse, deal with all their special needs, (and accompanying IEPs,) head off bullying, deal with allergies and medical conditions, worry about gender identity and sexuality, discipline fairly, deal with ""helicopter parents,"" check the boxes for college prep, and deal with the ever-present worry over school shootings.  

With all we're expecting from schools and teachers, it's a wonder anyone goes into this profession, or stays once they see the outlook.  

Common core, like No Child Left Behind, is a great idea on paper, that fails in implementation.  My kids went to school at a time when the policy was to insure teachers were well-educated.  There was a push to make them go back to college for additional courses, and they were tested themselves on what they were teaching their students.  It meant even more testing for students--to judge whether their teachers were up to the task.  At the same time, they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do better--like tenure.  They promoted the best teachers out of the classroom.  They took away teaching assistants due to the costs.  They increased class sizes.  And they started charter schools--which were experimental programs.  

Imagine if all those billions spent on common core, were used to pay teachers more--and get out of their way.",0

"I've been studying with the traditional academia style from my chidhood and I think this was one of the reasons of my deep unhappiness everytime I had to go to the school, and I agree the system can be totally useless when it comes to study died things in only books and not providing experiential oportunities to learn for children. Its a very serious matter that I hope will dramatically change very soon. I adapted to the system and became succesful in the studies but I can tell not in life. Sharing my experience, all the best to you guys",0
"Thanks, well done Sprouts and the visuals are just amazing. Dewey's theory is certainly viable if there is proper funding for Education. It It is  therefore easier to implement in a private school setting as compared to a public school one. A critic would be: how possible is it to find enough time within the term to implement the learning by doing eg planting and watching plants grow while at the same time covering the required syllabus?. For the discussions it is important that some teacher  instructions and prior reading and research happens before for the discussion/debate to be meaningful enough to sprout out new perspectives and ideas. 
For the interdisciplinary aspect to work, very strong school leadership is essential as well as a strong teamwork culture among staff as it would require a lot of sharing, consultations, planning and constant reviews.",1

"This thing is also evident in India. Students preparing for NEET/JEE (and for many other competitive exams) who pay lakhs of fees in coaching institutes get a remarkable edge over the students who can't afford to go to these coachings. Most of the teachers teaching at these institutes are IITians, doctors, etc. These coachings provide great facilities to their students, so the results are obvious. There are very few government colleges (of class 11 and 12) in India who actually prepare their students for these competitive exams. 
Also what I have noticed is that it's not just the school that you go to matters but also the kind of peer group which you have. Also, the support and thinking of your parents and the overall society and environment in which live matters when it comes to education.",1

I was fired for not smiling enough. The burnout rate was very, very high, especially because you had to get up at about 4 am to do it if you lived in America. The kids would be really young - the youngest I tutored was 3, too young to understand anything at all - and be in pajamas and finishing up their dinner, so like the last thing they wanted to do was stare at a computer and learn English, especially because the age range seemed to be 5-7-year-olds. Sometimes they would pick up the laptop they were on and just run around the room with it and the parents would give us bad marks for not keeping their child engaged enough. It was a really horrible job for both companies I worked for.",0
"In Kenya, I experienced the same. The KCSE is the one exam that can make or break your life. I slept for 5 hours a day. Lessons from 5 am to 8 pm. It was stressful. The pressure from parents and society is sometimes too much. I am glad it is all gone",0
"I'm 17 this year and am studying in an international high school in Shenzhen, China. I was in public school until high school; I'm grateful my parents provided me the opportunity to leave that stressful system. But I heard from my former classmates who are in the system that in recent years, the pressure on that system has been declining, but I can't be assured because I'm no longer in that system. Recalling my dark days in that system, I've always hated it because there was a lot of transcribing homework and memorizing poems and passages. When you fail to remember them, teachers will punish you by transcribing the poems and passages several times. I understand the reason why our government has such a system because we have such a vast population, and I do think it's relatively fair even though its fairness is declining, especially when this double reduction policy came down.",0
"I've been an edtech consultant in Beijing for 7 years. I've also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools. There are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive.

The first and foremost factor I would note is the lack of public discourse. This permeates through every part of society, especially education. If you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you, you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner: inquiry and reflection. In education, this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge. Even in history class there's no critical thinking or reflection involved, it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember. 

The second factor of note is barriers of information. The public does not have (easy) access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content, and even if they did get access, they wouldn't be able to recognize it. On top of that, there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as VIPKids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations. This causes market distortion, and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name (E.G. Wonders) and say that's their curriculum without any plan how to implement it.

The third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge. As stated in the first point, most of the population's education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection. If you've been taught not to question things your whole life, how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies?  How can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences? The result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good (or fishing consultants like me for free content).

The fourth factor is lack of foreign talent. There are not enough QUALIFIED teachers to meet demand. The general population would not be able to recognize one either. Many companies hire Russians, call them American, and slap a 200%+ markup on the course. It's up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content, instruction, and meet the unrealistic expectations the ""decision makers"" (sales people) set for the parents.

The final factor is who the decision makers are. Who decides what ""national curriculum"" is? Starting in 2020, private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the ""national curriculum"". This top-down decision making only exasperates the situation. It also permeates throughout the society. I've been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools.  Most of these decision makers are unqualified, they're sales people at best.
I should also mention that many parents have no clue about education, yet influence the schools with their misconceptions...but this is not the parents' fault. Rather, it's the school's fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program.

As for price... it's simply about demand vs supply.  Lack of foreign talent as mentioned before, combined with a desperate middle class (and higher) trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost. They will pay upwards of 200k RMB just to make it happen for their little Middle Schooler.

Unfortunately I exited the market, partially because the clients I had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problems...mostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum.",0
"The problem I have with those overly stressful education systems is that I wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them. What I learned through self-defense practice, and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus, and are not an effective way to learn. In self-defense, instructors increase stress by making you do cardio-based exercises to make your body artificially feel stress (accelerated heartbeat, difficulty to breath, difficulty to focus) only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal, but they don't do it for learning purposes. The military seems to do it too in their own way.
I would also point out that every doctor in the world (with common sense) would tell you that there is a considerable difference between the way we think we perform under fatigue and the way we actually perform under fatigue.
It's funny how the little girl in the video who had an allegedly stress-free education in kindergarten was able to catch up with her classmates in a few months.
I wonder how the students who went through this type of education system would perform against students from other countries. Here, in France, we don't have that type of education system, nor in the United Kingdom (I studied for 2 years at a British university).",0

It never helpd me improve my academic. I was always dead last in class. All it ever did to me was lowering my self confidence and give me anxiety. I'm never going back to those times.",0

"I found this very interesting, and as someone with ADHD-I, I had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it.

It brought up so many points of interest. With in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution, ADHD is considered an epidemic of our time, and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking. From the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses. As time went on this idea continued but in a different way. By the 1920's there was a drive towards raising the standards of living. People were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked, and live in the suburbs in a house, get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style.

But like he said in the talk, this type of trend doesn't work anymore. Styles of life are so divergent and it's obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women aren't going to be stay at home mom's and many can't. Actually during the 60's many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life. And as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living.

As for ADHD it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child. I believe ADHD is both a cause and symptom of behavior, but not always both. Take your eyes for example. You get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly, so you get prescription lenses. You now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription. And no one asks why.

No one asks why are you like this, how did it happen. Or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it. Yes and no. You can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions, but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met. Becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors. Your nutrition, your genetics and your life style. Actually  some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight, by changing their diet and their habits. For instance a child who stays inside all day, watching TV and playing videogames for hours, refuses to eat his vegetables and who's parents or relatives have had glasses, may develope near sightedness.

So in relation a child who has been mentally watching TV and playing videogames all day, not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity, exploring their real world, developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating, interacting socially with others around them, making constant decisions, based on logic, real feelings, and experiences, and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills, in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner. And it doesn't just go for ADHD. This could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty. In varying degrees of course. But it is believed that behavior (in any form) is partially learned and partially developed. And by developed I mean the way your brain developed. How your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works.

Going back to education you can see why this factory mind set can't work for everyone. As well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts, you find contradiction. Most people don't understand the arts. Most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesn't make sense anymore. Truth is that area of education evolved, but only by those who pursue it, would understand. A big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world. The A grade is the pinacle of that idea.  Do perfectly in your education and you get an A. 

Well this doesn't really work in the art world. You still get graded when you do your work and do it well, but school is for practicing the academics. In art you study academics as well, like art history, art Theory, and your use of a medium like drawing or painting. What you don't get graded on is on the things that can't be measured, like your idea, your creativity, and the value of your work. Though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill. But when it comes right down to it, art isn't about any of this or it can be about all of it. It can be about how others value your work, it can be about how divergent your work seems to be, it can be about how well your work matches a subject, it can be about how well you use methods of design, it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people, and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic (AKA art competition or auction). So in a way it is chaotic to the point people can't make sense of it any more, but it is not inherently measurable and perfected.

It is the product of ideas. And ideas are valued above all else. And yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms, and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty.",1
"I've been listening to this guy's speeches all day and it just resonates with me more than anything I have seen in a long time. I was misdiagnosed with adhd in elementary school (this wonderful psychologist actually told me in 5th grade that it was a misdiagnosis so I know). So I spent 5 years believing I had adhd when all I had was this thing called childhood. Eventually in 10th grade I switched to an alternative school and everything Robinson has said regarding alternative schools in his other speeches is spot on. I'm a senior at my alternative school, going to college next year and this school has had a profound impact on me. I'll spare the details, but I just want to confirm that alternative schools are very often the solution and right now what I'm most passionate about is making this education revolution happen and I will do everything in my power to achieve this. I wouldn't have this passion if it were not for my alternative school experience, which inspired learning instead of forcing conformity. 

Much thanks to Ken Robinson for his words of wisdom and innspiration andsharing his vision with us.",1

"I certainly remember being much better at being creative when I was younger, but now that I'm a freshman in High School, I've noticed that I'm much worse at the whole creativity thing. Now, the problem is, I'm being praised. Why? I am great at finding the one answer. I can take tests very well, but am typically not the best at projects. Math is my best subject, English is my worst, where you typically have to write creative essays. I want to be an engineer, so at my school, we have an elective called pre-engineering. It's one of the closest classes to an actual job that's available at my school. And I'm not the best at it. Sure I can do the math required, but coming up with ideas for better designs is hard. I feel that this shows that my education is doing the opposite of preparing me for the future. It's telling me that there's one answer, which is never the case in engineering. I hope that soon enough we can have an education overhaul, and realize that we need to change education.",0

You're free to come up with any ideas of your own so long as you have the evidence to back it up.",1

"What parents expect from us during school:

Constant Straight A’s.
Good social life.
All that.


What they don’t expect:

Stress
Depression
Social Awkwardness



School just sucks. Having to determine all self worth on a high or low grade just makes you upset and then fear what happens as a consequence.
I hate how parents don’t understand that school can genuinely give a child depression, and mental health issues because they REFUSE to think like their child: they always say that we aren’t depressed, just faking it for attention.

I had a mental breakdown once, all I was asked was why did I cry. And that there had to be a reason.

"I loved my 7th and 8th grade math teacher, his goal was to make the class love math. He said he loved when people failed, and he also only checked homework because the school system made him. He did the best he was allowed to, and this goes to show that you shouldn't blame the teachers, you shouldn't blame the people who designed the school system [around 150 years ago], you should blame the people who *keep* the school system the same, never changing it to suite modern needs more. Modern schools are near identical to ones over 150 years ago, which were designed to mass produce factory workers. Let that sink in.",1

"As a 33 year veteran teacher, I suggest that you talk to teachers about their working conditions. The disrespect has infected the classrooms. Teachers are being verbally and physically attacked by students and even parents on a daily basis. A lot of this stems from mental health issues, yet nothing is ever done about it.",0
"Low wages, harassment,  bullying, KARENs, lack of security, respect, paperwork, working conditions, pay, safety, updated and fact based books, etc. Plus who the heck wants to worry about being murdered at their job, not having security taken seriously by those in charge( this will NEVER happen at are school) attitude.",0
"It's hardly surprising. Even in rich districts teachers are underpaid, undervalued, and overworked. They are expected to take on more responsibilities every year with fewer and fewer resources, all while administrators ignore their pleas and parents treat them like overqualified babysitters. My wife quit teaching several years ago. She was working 6-7 days a week and spending hundreds of dollars a month on supplies just to keep her classroom running, and the school gave her absolutely no support with unruly students.",0
"Respect for teachers is not just about the salary -- although an increase in salary is sorely needed. Teacher pay has always been lower than other professions with the same education and experience. It's also about respect for the profession. Student behavior, in my view, can be linked to the disrespect for teachers they're seeing parents, administrators, and politicians demonstrate. Hiring a person trained as a soldier to teach is VERY disrespectful to the profession. As a teacher, I don't feel qualified to do the job of a soldier; i respect the profession too much. The ""anybody can teach"" attitude is not only insulting, it's ignorant.",0
Who wants to get shot in the classroom while trying to protect these disrespectful students who cuss you out on a daily basis?!?,0
I was raised in a teaching family when the profession was respected and teacher strikes unheard of.  Fast forward to a major university where teaching majors walk away from the profession after their first classroom experiences.  Why would any sane person want to be in a job when they are disrespected or not trusted so much?,0
"DECADES of ""we need to cut the education budget"" created an environment where supplies are now being provided at cost to the teachers, larger classes, low respect (with more flak being thrown their way this year due to BS rhetoric), denigration from political grand standers, and then pile on top this push for parents wanting to directly interfere in the teacher's professional conduct.

You have caused the great resignation of teachers. Own up to it and fix your funding priorities.",0
"So it turns out that if you underpay and undervalue teachers, nobody wants to be a teacher. Huh, go figure.",0

"I’m 67 years old and have lived my entire life in Mississippi.  #43 is a huge win in that every time I have observed state rankings regarding quality of life issues we are nearly always #50.

"As someone who's from MD and lives in PA - Pennsylvania came higher than I expected and Maryland was lower. Baltimore probably dragged Maryland down, but PA is a surprise. That's because Pennsylvania schools are funded through a system called ""school taxes"", where each of the 500 school districts (spread across 67 counties) levy their own property taxes to fund their schools. That's why someone living next door to you can be paying twice as much in taxes to go to a school half as good. This system has been known to disproportionately affect rural and urban school districts and tip in favor of school districts in suburban communities, or those in the Poconos where they have resorts that people own condos at.",0

"According to WalletHub the best state in the country for “quality of education” is Massachusetts followed by California, according to research released  (January 21, 2019) by WalletHub. The study was part of WalletHub’s annual ranking of the “Most & Least Educated States in America.” This year’s ranking combined two categories — educational attainment and quality of education — broken down by 20 “relevant metrics.” Massachusetts placed first in both categories followed by California. 

While the educational attainment category is based solely on the percentage of residents with high school, associates, undergraduate, and graduate diplomas, quality of education includes 16 metrics ranging from quality of public high schools to quality of public universities to educational attainment based on gender and race. Within that category, California follows Massachusetts. Rounding out the top five for quality of education are Florida, Maryland, and Vermont, respectively.",1
"I grew up in Mass and the schools were excellent.  That said my kids go to school in Los Angeles and there are some great public schools here. My daughter went to a French immersion public school in Glendale, CA. I felt like she got a pretty amazing and unique education.",1
The closest I got to college was watching the professor on Gilligan's Island. That must put me a few points ahead.,1
"I'm from CA and I find this super surprising. While overall our stats suck, when you look at the exceptions, the smart kids here astound me. At Dimanomd Bar I knew this kid who was talking calc 1 as a Sophmore in high school. I also met this Taiwanese girl who was taking data structures and algorithms at 16 and recently got into UC Berkeley. I think while overall our stays suck, our top scholars here can top other scholars. After all, the UC system has some of the most prestigious Universities according to US News",1
"Nothings wrong with going to college its the fact that we are traditionally taught that we all need to go to college to be successful when in fact college isnt for everyone and especially isn’t the only way to succeed in life.
Same people that tell you to go to college are paying debt still from it.
How the rich stay rich and poor stay poor.",0
"Exactly! As a member of GenX, a lot of us are still paying off our loans but yet are gonna send our kids to do the same thing 20+ years later? I think not. I say this as a person with a bachelor's and masters degree! I encourage young people to get as much education for free or as cheaply as they can. The important thing is OUTPUT. If you produce good work, academic or otherwise, you'll always be in demand. 

With the internet, people are able to start ALL sorts of income producing ventures without high overhead. You can become a software programmer using tutorials online  and make plenty of money. You can learn a trade with only two years of study via community college. If you've got the mind to start your own company afterwards, THEN get a business degree when you're able to pay as you go. You can learn digital marketing without a degree.",1
My son is a senior in high school this year. He says he might choose community college but doesn't want a 4 year university. Trade school is fine too. I think he just doesn't know what he wants to do with his life yet and that's okay. I went to college and spent 12 years paying it off just to decide later that social work was not for me. I don't understand why kids have to rush into a lifelong career when they haven't even had the opportunity to live life yet. I want my child to explore different career paths before he chooses one. I'm in no rush to kick him out. All I ask is that he works or goes to school. I don't want him to be out on his own until he has money saved in the bank and a stable job. I want him to know how to budget and manage his finances properly. I don't want him to struggle living paycheck to paycheck trying to make ends meet. He can go to college anytime if he chooses to do so. There's no age limit.,0
"As a millenial I cant help feeling like we were the experiemental group with university somehow. How much could colleges charge and get away with? How far can they upsell this idea of helping people get better jobs by going in debt for the rest of their lives? Its ridiculous that celebrating paying off student loans is even a thing in the first place. 

Now that the next gen has seen the effects, they are only taking logical next steps to ensure their own security. Universities is just way too expensive...on top of that, theres cost of housing and food and transportation. If it were more affordable, I truly believe more kids absolutely would go.

 BUT if someone in that position asked me for advice I would always advise them to at least complete community college and 2 year degrees or certification programs at the very least, in a practical field. Many include internships that have great potential to lead to decent jobs.",0
I find this so awesome. I hope these colleges are FORCED to significantly drop their prices. They sucked American students dry. Crippled an entire generation of millennials from being homeowners and ever building financial security. Now it's finally coming to a head and it's long overdue. I hope students find great jobs and stay out of debt.,1

"Masters Union cannot replace institutions like IIM or IIT because of the sheer fact that MU does not have to comply with the guidelines of a college or a university. Indian colleges or Universities don't have any place in the top institutes of the world (and rightly so) but something that an IIT or IIM has to deal with that none of the other institutes in the world deals with is the implementation of the reservation policy.
Because of the implementation of reservation, there is a possibility that a huge chunk of the people who get into IIMs and IITs be lacking in certain core subjects (Dont assume I am a casteist because I am outlining a drawback in reservation policy. I completely support the reservation policy and every caste is now enjoying the benefit of reservation) and so the faculty of these institutions have to compensate for this drawback and this becomes a huge stepback in achieving wonderful things within a span of 200 years but, the reservation policy gives students from poor and rural backgrounds who haven't had access to great education in their schools/colleges an access to great education when it comes to their higher education. But in an institution like Masters Union (going by their fees structure and the absence of any deferral of fees payment or scholarship) the students generally come from priveleged backgrounds, who have had access to great education since kindergarten. While Masters union assures great education, institutions like IITs and IIMs, ensure social equity and great education
(The entire para is based on my knowledge that there are no reservations in MU)",0

"That glass pane-beacon thing was neat, I liked that. Though I find beacon beams kind of unsightly in general. I kind of wish you could have the boosted effect without the beam. I know Vanilla Tweaks has a resource to have them be invisible to me, but that doesn't mean EVERYONE isn't seeming my base just SURROUNDED in beams. Maybe they could make tinted glass function as a ""beam nullifier"" while still maintaining effects? That'd be nice.",1

I also like that you mentioned learning from your mistakes. The key is to make sure you go back over your practice!

What could be the probable reason according to you? Please help. I really feel frustrated and hopeless now to think that even after practicing so many questions I'm not able to get a 1400+ score.

Thanks for sharing! The “study like it’s your last test” even though you’re taking it twice is an interesting approach. I get the value in it but I actually say the opposite to my students because they get so stressed out. I tell them not to worry and just relax in there because they can always take it again! Also the focus on the math first I like - I’ll actually have them only do one portion of the test with me for the whole month or two and then take the test and then do the other portion for a whole month or two to SuperScore,1

Wow. Tomorrow is my test and I have been studying all summer. This video was more helpful than all my summer studying combined (I took a SAT prep course at my school also). I mean it. Thank you!,1
I love that you’re going fast and at an accurate speed for the real exam. Love your techniques so much. THANK YOU! Please keep these coming🙏💕,1
Here in India even 7th class exam comes harder than this,0
"Straight forward with no bs. Thank you, this is so much better than any professional help.",1
I've been studying on Khan academy for a couple of weeks now using their SAT practice problems. Watching you do this has helped me so much more than that has thus far. Thanks!,1
"I've taken the SAT 3 times. The most frustrating part about the SAT is that unless you're at an advanced level in math or above the ""normal"" level for your grade, there's a high chance you won't understand or even recognize over 50% of the material and questions. The first time I took it I barely understood a lot of the math on it because I wasn't even completely through Algebra 2. 

Long story short I hate standardized testing and I feel as though a lot of kids are set up for failure T_T. I'm lucky I got to take it multiple times this year since I understand most of the math now.",0
"I'm going to take the test in five days and I just found out this video 😭
Thanks for sharing",1
Really informative! Thank you.,1
"omg as an international student, i was kinda hopeless abt this exam before i found your channel bu damn your videos are lit and i feel better now 👁️👄👁️📚🕯️",1
You are life and time saver. Thank you ☺. May god bless you!🤲,1
Thanks for this video!! taking my SAT in a few weeks,1
Great video keep them coming,1
"Hey, thank you so much for your help. Do you have any tips for sophomores taking the PSAT for the first time? I greatly appreciate it.😃",1
You are unique bro. Thanks a lot for your time and effort.,1
I watched this video and somehow raised my score from 1430 (Sept 26 SAT) to 1500 (Oct 3 SAT) in 1 week wow! thank you so much,1
"I wanted at least a 1300. That was my goal, my minimum. I Got an 1170. Now I’m retaking it senior year but I’m completely dejected. I have a couple weeks left. I’m really trying to understand things better. People are counting on me.",0
This is so helpful! I’m also trying to raise my original score around 300 points to get in the 1500s range and seeing that you were able too helps me see that it’s possible! :),1
"Let me tell you my story :) first time I took my PSAT when I was in freshmen year and I got a 560 😂 I took it again in sophomore year and I got 940 , I took the psat again in junior year and I got 1200+ , I’ve been self studying past 5 months and I think I can get 1400+ ..",1
"My tip: if you know you’re taking the ACT, study for that FIRST! The timing of the ACT is much faster so if you study hard and get used to it, the SAT will seem like a piece of cake! (At least that’s how it was for me)",1
"Honestly, for me at least, knowing that there will be another opportunity really relieved my test anxiety and I ended up with a much better score than I predicted!",1
"That’s so funny… we got the EXACT same first two SAT scores (1190 and 1360)! Hoping that’s a good sign, and through hard work and dedication, there will be a 1510 in my future!!",1
I took it at the end of my sophomore year and got a 1310. Just took it again 2 months into junior year and got a 1400. My Superscore is a 1440 combining my 2 tests. Hoping this video helps me reach the 1500 I want by the end of my junior year.,1
"Thank you so much! I’m currently studying for the SAT as well, and I really recommend the college panda books, including Erika Meltzer’s Critical reading for the reading section!",1
"Totally not trying to cram everything in one night... good luck on everyone else who’s taking it tomorrow!

Small update: the test wasn’t so bad I think overall it’s the stress we put on ourselves. Just be sure to read everything carefully and not to second guess too much. If a question is hard skip it and come back later. Get the points you know you for certain understand and can get and then the rest",1
"God bless this man. I'm a college drop out who's trying his best to go back to school and get his education degree, but never took the SAT while I was in high school. (21 btw.) Hoping I can pull thru and prove myself as a capable individual.",1
i have my SAT next week and i think this was the most useful 26 minutes of my entire quarantine. thank you.,1
This gives me so much more confidence. I love the way you easily break it down in a way and quickly explain it all. Really needed this,1
I wish I would've looked for this video a lot sooner. The SAT is tomorrow for me.,0
"I took mine in March and I’m not happy with my score so I’m retaking in in 2 weeks, June.  This video has been an amazing help. Just finished the first one and about to move on to the next one. Great video and fantastic explanation.",1
"You did a great job! SAT Math is not easy, I wish it was easier for students to beat it! Good luck guys!",1
"You know, I am always extremely stressed out during the SAT so my mind gets cluttered because I'm thinking of all the things it could be asking, but the fact that this is all just summarized so well honestly helps me out big time for my SAT happening next year! Thank you for the help! :D",1
"Dear last minute SAT prep gang,
  Breathe. This test doesn't define you. You'll do great. Stop scrolling through the comments, get back to working. You can do this. Have the mental breakdown later and make a meme out of it. You'll be fine.",1
"When you're watching this as a ""refresher"" but realize you know nothing",0

"to everyone watching this video: it works. All math that you will see on the exam is reviewed in this video. My score went up 150 points after watching this video. I'm taking the SAT this Saturday to shoot for the 1500s, but I just wanted to say that this is an amazing video and it really is comprehensive!!! Good use of your time to watch this 2 days before your test date and do at least one practice test :)",1
"Just here trying to learn 3 years of math into my head in a weekend before the test on Tuesday  (April 13 2021)😔
we all in the same struggle good luck to who ever reading this on your SAT",0
"Graduated 24 years ago, when a SAT or ACT was not required. Now, I'm looking at going to college and have to take the SAT or ACT (after 24 years!!!). Thank you. It helps to find a crash course! Still very nervous but this helps!",1
"You did a great job explaining! Nothing is easy on Math SAT! A question could be 5 sentences long and your heart just drops! Anyone who takes SAT is a Hero! Press on, guys!",1
"to each and every one of you struggling about your sat, i hope you all get a good scores",1
"Rensselaer Polytechnic is such a gem of a school, it's a shame it wasn't even mentioned on this list. After graduating my oldest went to Microsoft and my second went to Amazon, both for Software Engineers. My third has his foot in the door for JNJ for Chem Eng. They were average kids that got an incredible education as proven by their technical interviews. I think you really need to mention RPI in more of your videos. <3",1
"i’ve been watching since freshmen year, heading into my senior year now. i self studied with many tips from here and got a 1500 today! thank you!!",1
"Thanks for sharing! I am really glad you put this video in the context of what schools the student is looking to apply to, since SAT scores are all relative. Since I score a 1500+, it blows my mind to think about being in the top 99%. I think the part about scores being inflated because schools don't have to report bad test scores since students aren't submitting bad tests scores makes sense. However, I do tell my students that submitting scores is beneficial to them if they can because the U.S. World News Report requires a school to report at least 50% of its students' scores in order for them to remain competitive in the rankings. Thus, more elite schools will take more students with scores than without to maintain their coveted spots!",1
"Hi Brooke, 
Great video as always. Quick Question: 
Do you think the SAT will serve of any relevance for students of the class of 2027 and beyond? 
Regards,",1

I’m actually kinda nervous cause I’m taking my sat tomorrow and did no studying whatsoever. Watching this give me some confidence thx,0
Not me watching this 8 hours before I take the test-,0
"I got a 1420 with little preparation, everyone here will be fine. Even if you don’t get the score you want, life goes on.",1
"I received a score of 1270, though it’s only a part of what the colleges are looking for. In my case, my high school grades steadily improved throughout the 4 years with my junior year ending in around 3.8 GPA and 4.0 GPA for my senior year.

I was accepted into 3 UC schools, PennState, and a guaranteed transfer to Boston University",1
"To be honest about this whole thing: 
You're right, you don't have to study the knowledge you accumulated from 9th to 11-12th grade. All you have to know are the tricks- (wealthy people pay just for this)- to the test and that's the only way possible to get a high score. It's like a very special system to weed out the people who can't afford to go to college. I feel sorry for this, because education should be affordable to all.",0
"Retaking it tomorrow, got a 940 last time so let’s hope it goes well this time
Edit: I got a 1070!🎊",1
The guy who invented SATs sounds like the type of kid to remind the teacher about the homework,0
"I’m surprised they didn’t mention how you have to pay to take the test. Seriously, it’s one of the most obvious ways of why and how it measures family income over actual intelligence - rich people can just take the test more.",0
So you’re telling me. If this person didn’t had this weird fascination of ranging peoples intelligence into some kind of scale/meter format that I wouldn’t have to stress over SATS so much-,0
The SAT is still way easier than most other country's entrance exams,1
"Half the comments on this video are “lol you guys think the SAT is hard wait til you learn about (insert random country’s standardized test)”. The discussion surrounding this video shouldn’t be “mine is harder and therefore better”, it should be about how bad standardized testing is and how it really isn’t a measure of intelligence, just of taking the test.",0
"all these people commenting ""i'm poor and i got a 1300 by studying a lot"" 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ we are talking about that poor people on average are less likely to get a great score, not that it's impossible! There is a difference between inequality in general and a specific success story",0
“Low scores should never be a veto on a student’s life” - that hit me hard,0

4 YEARS OF MATHS WITHIN 3 HOUR OMG THANK YOU,1
"Before I get into my comment I would like to say thank you, I really appreciate that fact that you take the time out of your own day making these incredible useful TikTok s and YouTube videos so people can study even though your not making anything off of it. Back to the point, id like to say thank you because right now I’m a freshman and I didn’t really have a motivation to study for the act but when I was scrolling through tik tok I saw a video with a really hard math problem but you made it seem really easy like I could do it in a minute so after that I did more research and found out how important the act really is so I’ve been studying with your YouTube and tiktok videos along with other things on the side, i still have 2 years before I have to take it but your videos are so entertaining they make me want to learn and get better at math.",1
im watching this the night before my SAT...we love procrastination,1
I improved by 130 points on my SAT and this was a big part of it thank you so much for making this video we ALL appreciate it and you,1
"You can't imagine the magnitude of my gratitude towards you, thanks man",1
I lowkey just started crying out of appreciation for u and all u do for us,1
This is the some of the best math help I’ve ever found for the SAT,1
"As junior year is stressful as it already is. My man, I want to thank you so much for helping me out. I feel confident about the SAT now",1
im worried i cant do my SAT on August TT any further more techniques please?,0
"The biggest problem for me right now is that I’m working during the day, I try to study from 7-8:30 am but then I have to catch the bus to go to work at 10, and then I work until 4, but get home at 5. Then I have to walk my dog/eat dinner and can only start studying at 9 again. But I wake up at 6 so it’s so hard to find time",0
so excited that I graduated high school and I get to take the SAT again because I want to transfer.,1

A girl in my school just got accepted into Yale with a full ride scholarship. She deserves it and I'm so proud of her!,1
“Yeah the SAT is unnecessary” everyone proceeds to get 1500’s,0
Wow glad to see that Yale students are so humble and friendly,1
"I just graduated from law school and attended Washington U in St. Louis for my undergrad. It is so interesting seeing all of these people a few years behind me talk about stats, scores, and extracurriculars. Yale and other elite schools can really and truly set you up for life. But just remember, if your scores aren’t this amazing or you don’t get into your dream school, you still have a wonderful life ahead of you. I’ve taken classes at community college, public universities and private universities, and your education really is what you make of it. College is only a few years out of the rest of your life, and I wish in high school I had known that and spent more time making memories and less time worried about my GPA. Just my two cents, and amazing that all of these students are so accomplished at such young ages!",1
hey queen! girl you have done it again. constantly raising the bar for us all and doing it flawlessly. i’d say i’m surprised but i know who you are. i’ve seen it up close and personal. girl you make me so proud👑👑,1
"2:56 
as an IB student, the person who was predicted to get a 44— thats actually insanely impressive, i would say much more so than the gpas. that's a 44/45, which means top marks on every exam but one, plus top marks on other things like essays core to the program",1
"As fun as these videos are, I do want to give a certain amount of warning to HS students. Just because you have the grades, scores, letters of rec, essays, and extracurriculars doesn’t mean you’ll be accepted into these schools. I was denied to all of my colleges despite having a 3.8/4.23, a 1490, and being on a nationally recognised robotics and rocketry team. I even did robotics research in HS at a university, applied to the university, and then was denied from that university. So much of it is just an arbitrary lottery, it’s hard to truly know.",0
"2:56 and 3:19, having a 44 IB predicted score is way more impressive than getting a 4.0 gpa, we have a monster on our hands",1
"This is unknown territory for me. It's fascinating. I dropped out of high school in 10th grade due to multiple reasons, but mostly due to feeling overwhelmed and lost without any guidance. I'm proud of these kids cause they don't all come from privilege. They worked hard.",1
I like watching these videos cuz they do be inspiring me to continue my college education. In highscool I was a 2.0 gpa student. Barely putting the effort to muster a C. My only way getting into college was soccer but eventually I quit due to mental health. I was really depressed and didn’t have any motivation for anything. Had no friends no job and overall I was in a bad state in hs. I just turned 20 now back in community college trying to get a degree eventually gonna transfer. But yeah would’ve wished i had better guidance and wished I could go back and change that so I wouldn’t have made it harder on myself. I didn’t even go to prom no football game nothing and overall had no social life. Starting to change now How I am now and it’s honestly making me a better person and happier. Seeing you guys so happy at Yale is motivation and brings me joy. You guys are very smart and I also admire your hard work you put in and the sacrifice.,0
Super useful! I wish I had this when I was doing SATs. <3,1
"I got a score of 1170 when I took the practise test offered by Khan academy , with a 570 on maths and 600 on english . In my defense , It was my first attempt and I wasn't really expecting it to be this long . I found your video helpfull and hope you make more sat related content.",1
"This was so informative. I'm in ICSE board, and in 8th grade, and I know that might sound a little early to start doing all of this, but frankly, I've been freaking out about my entire future a lot (let's just not get into that) and your video helped assuage some of my worries. Thanks so much, <3",1
"Hey Avanti !
It would be really great to see you solving the commonly asked questions :)",1
"I'm not taking the SATs but still sat through the entire thing. I'm a Master's student stuck in India waiting to get back to the US. It just feels good to watch your videos. As weird as it may sound, your videos are helping me stay hopeful",1
Thank you so much for this video! It was so informative and really helped someone like me who isn’t be familiar with these type of exams. Could you also make a video about essays and how to write an impactful one to get into Harvard?,1

The only caution I’d have with your strategies is to avoid any sort of generalizing as you did with finding the word that fits in context. While that is the case most of the time, I’ve seen collegeboard switch it up before. (they’re rude like that) You’re killing it tho; keep up the good content!",1
"Bro, you are actually a god. I just took the SAT today and it went so well. The only thing I did from my previous attempt in August is try using your strategy and my performance magically improved. I swear I’ve spent so much time trying to improve; I practiced over 3000 questions, read prep books, and studied under tutoring, yet my score decreased every attempt through the past year.

"I did extremely well on the SAT. I went to a great college where I met my current lovely wife. Soon I reached my PhD in physics. I got a job as a professor at Harvard university, and at around 37 years and of age I had my first child, a gorgeous baby girl. Later on I earned my most prized achievement, the Nobel Prize, for figuring out how to manifest the theoretical push of gravity into an accessible fuel source. Boy, how I love Sims...",1
"I got a 1500 on my SATs, I went to a community college, got my associates, transferred to a 4 year college, did super well there, went to School of Medicine at UW, and I'm almost done with my residency.",1
How the hell you get 2200 out 2400 and end up working at buzzfeed,0
these people all got better scores than me. I think the SAT shows how well you can take a test...not how well you understand the subject. I'm a terrible test taker.,0
"No talking during the exam, you all failed",0
"This is the entire problem with the SAT system, it's not about the knowledge it's the tricks in taking the exam. Things like SAT prepping and all other things should not be encourage when taking it. In real statistics term, the results you get from taking the test are false because you've practice to jacked up your score.",0
"They got high scores... I got a 1800, and I thought I did good.",1
"No way these SAT scores were accurate. 2300 out of 2400? Yea okay, someone doesn't know how the scoring works!",0
"First of all, let me clear up the misunderstanding about why Asians do well in life: we do not always send kids off to academic supplements, SAT study classes, etc... Obviously, there are those parents are ultimately force their child to go, but there are a plethora that do just as well, if not better on these types of activities (SAT, ACT, GPA, school, etc...) without any additional help, aside from a practise test book from the local library. That is me, and I can affirm that for many Asian kids, we have an inherent need to do good, make our parents proud (no matter how much pressure we have), and have a high-level job and go to Ivy League schools in order to help support our parents later in life since they spend all of their savings on us. We push for the best because of our work ethic, not because all Asians have ""oh so much money"". For the majority of our parents, as immigrants, it is nearly impossible to imagine the labour, the hard work, the exhaustion, and the prejudice they have faced in the past, all to provide their children with more opportunities. It is not that Asians are inherently smarter, or richer, or more privileged in any ways (although there are those select few), but because of the bitterness we have faced to shape us into who we are today. Asians are no different from others of ethnic origin, to say: Mexicans, African-Americans, Indians, and other ""dis-privileged minorities"" in the States. The only difference is how we choose to approach life and its difficulties. Do we lie down and wait for others to donate things to us or do we choose to fight until the end? I am not trying to start up any racial slurs, cursing, or insultations of any kind, just putting out a thought and consideration for you all. Obviously, there are many successful, talented, and kind people from all ethnic origins as well as bad ones, but I am just making a point here: Why would the high-level universities offer an easier acceptance rate based on race rather than achievement if they did not truly believe in the concept of ""racial preference"" or ""racial advantage""? Note I put that in quotations, meaning I myself do not think that is a fact. There are hard-working and lazy people, smart and ignorant, good and bad in any race, it is just how we choose to present ourselves and represent our beliefs and race to the rest of the generalising public. So tell me, why should one race get more ""sympathy"" or ""preference"" over another? Can we not just all be equal human beings? It is like saying ""red is better than pink!"" Why? ""Oh, because it is true!"" without an explanation. So, what the lady teacher in the video says really hit me, due to how personal it felt as a 10th grade Chinese girl, and I wanted to share the truth to everyone. Thank you for understanding with an open heart and mind and hopefully, we can all start changing society little by little, with messages like this! No enmities I hope! :)",1

"Bruh, I just took a practice test after watching your first full review.  I went from a 580 to a 720 in maths, went down in reading though :( 590 to 570, but anyway, thank you so much,  turning off adblocker specifically for your videos. I truly appreciate it. 

Edit: Now I got a 770 on the actual exam, I have a chance of my Dream school cause of you.  Thank you😄",1
"just found out i have to take them in LESS THEN A WEEK. super stressing rn, i feel so unprepared. thank you, this was so helpful!!",1
"I’m taking my SAT in March and I want to get between a 1350-1450 and I have the same book and I’m just ready to use your plan and grind it out for the next month!
Thanks for all the tips!!!",1
This is my junior year of high school and all I can think about is scoring a high score on the SAT (along with my 2 AP classss). I just took the PSAT today and I won’t be getting back results till December. In the meantime I want to create a study plan where I can get in practice every day and take practice tests on the weekends. I have the rest of my junior year to study and I’m aiming for a 1400 at highest. I hope your tips work for me :),1
Just want to put it out there that you don’t need to buy the prep book to access the eight official SAT practice tests! They are available online on the College Board website and free for you to download and print! Also Khan Academy allows you to take those tests on your computer (or just input your answers) and they will score it for you and give you practice recommendations!,1
this girl is an actual genius. i studied for 5 months and barely got a 1500...,1
"As an international student, your tips are helping me a lot, thank you so much for it ;)",1
Thank you this really helped. I only have 2 weeks left until I take my sat so hopefully I will do well. I hope you make more great videos :),1
"I am an international student,  I have my final high school exams in 5 months and that's the biggest external exam taken in my country and at the same time I have my SATs in 2 months 
I really love your study plan and really hope it will work for me too",1
"Omg, the fact that you said that all I need is a month and a half makes me feel SO much better. That is the exact amount of time I have left(actually there's even 5 extra days since my test is on June 5), and I was just panicking because I just started revising today. Thank you for relieving my stress haha:)",1
I got the same PSAT score and had that same “omg I need insane scores to get in” moment but with Princeton lmaoo. I have a 760 reading and 650 math hopefully I’ll be able to get my math up by December 4th🙏🙏,1
Hope everyone gets a perfect 1600 😀,1
"My predictions (will edit after I get results):

Reading/writing: 710-740
Math: 790-800
Overall: 1500-1540

Edit 1 (a few hours after taking the test): Feel really confident about the math section, reading was way easier than usual, and writing had a bunch of easy questions but had a few that I couldn't figure out the differences (parts of sentence replacement, not grammar)

Edit 2 (1-2 months after taking the test): yea... I forgot about where I left this comment. Anyways I took two SATs, march 2nd school day and march 12th.

2nd: r/w 750, math 790, overall 1540
12th: r/w 760, math 800, overall 1560
superscore the same as 12th

honestly surprised with reading/writing, especially the reading section. I missed 1 reading on the 2nd (but that was 40 subsection so didn't matter) and 4 on the 12th. 5 writing on 2nd and 1 on writing.

Math I missed 1 question due to not reading carefully and 1 because I didn't know how to do it on the 2nd, but perfect score on the 12th.

if I got the reading section of the 2nd and the writing section of the 12th on the same day, I could have a score of 1590.

definitely not taking the SAT again",1
Thank you for all your advice. Tomorrow is my big day so fingers crossed 😁😁,1
Perfect timing! I was just about to look for some last minute tips for my test tomorrow 😊,1
"My predictions:

Reading/Writing: 630-680
Math: 750-800

Edit (After taking it)😭😭

Math: 710-740
Overall: 1330-1400

My Results:
Reading/Writing: 650

Omg, since this is my last chance, I’m really nervous right now! I really hope that everyone’s hard work will pay off .<3",1

790 math (i will miss 1 question because i either miscounted squares on a graph or multiplied numbers wrong)

I'm a junior who's trying to get a 1470+ on the SAT this year. I took it last year and got a 930. I have to study like hell.,0
You got a 1310 on your very first try?! That’s crazy!!,1
I didn’t even know what the SAT was until sophomore year because my parents didn’t know much about how the school system worked here and I’m the oldest so it’s all firsts 😰,0
Watching this as a senior is too late lol 😂😂😂 please don’t procrastinate like I did :(( study a lot!!!!!,0
"HEY YOU! if you're reading this and you're about to take the sat, i just wanna say: *you're gonna do great*
if you want more motivation, if you wanna be hyped up a lil more, keep reading.
while i was studying for my sats, i kept telling myself:
""this is the only thing that's academically important to do that is *secluded* from school. meaning that there are *no teachers or classmates* to hinder/interrupt your learning. THIS TEST IS 100% THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT YOU PUT IN!""
so that's just really something to think about while you're going into this test. i wish you all the best <3",1
idk if everyone has access to khan academy but that helps too and provides practice,1
Can we get a video on how a company that sucks so much money out of students is supposed to be non-profit?,0
So 4 mistakes in math takes you down to 710.....the things people do for money....,0
"So I took the SAT practice test 10 right... I usually score 1360-1400 on a practice test. I make a total of 5 mistakes on the math section on a bad day, which is what happend. Usually it will translate to a score of 730-740. I did pretty well on reading (33/52) and writing (40/44) sections. I'm excited to calculate my score and then... I see the horrific truth:
40/44 in writing is translated to 330 (70 points deducted for 4 wrong answers).
33/52 is translated to 280 (Fine).
53/58 is translated to 710 (90 points deducted for 5 wrong answers). 
A total of 1320. Even though I did exteramly good in the writing section, just above averge in reading (which is a totally flawed section but that's another topic), and amazing in the math section I got a just above average score that gives me no chance hypothetically to get into my dream school. 
AM I A JOKE TO YOU??????",1
"Thank you for your video
Could you arrange a video for the international students application for scholarships? Where are the official dependable web sites? The requirements. Everythings",1
I remember a few years back I got a single question wrong on the PSAT reading section and it dropped me three points out of the 38 possible. Explain to me how it's not curved,0
The fact that they don’t score on a curve is a completely lie and was contradicted in the video. What do u call saying that one test is harder than another  so they can get more wrong. Even if this is true there are so many ways to combat this with still making sure that there is no cheating. This is especially true in the math section where y literally have to change numbers because the concepts that you are testing should be the same or relatively similar. And even though this may be harder for the English section when it comes to the documents and essay there are still many ways to make sure that there is not too much of a differentiation that it would merit a CURVE because there is no other word for what ur doing.,0

"As a junior almost halfway through my year I'm quite surprised that I never thought hard about taking this test. I never focused on what I need or when I will. This really makes me realize how it's a new, complete thing to work hard on and I'm scared but thankful to see this video",1
"I've been tutoring the SAT for 29 years. This version of the test is the fourth version I have taught. I'm very happy with this video's emphasis on quality studying over cramming and using actual SAT questions. The stressing of analyzing your wrong answers to see how you could get a question similar to it correct in the future is exactly how to go about it. 

I have an important side note. The fact that a student needs to do all this prep just because the test is a mass of eccentricities is one of many indicators of just how bogus the SAT really is.",1

"Thank you for the info! 
Im a Brazilian student struggling if it's worth applying to the US. 
I did a in-depth research, some “mock” sat’s at home, and have a strong sympathy for certain American colleges' education structure as compared to Brazilian or European universities, which I'm fortunate to have the citizenship in both places. Nevertheless, if I do decide to take this time to apply and commit to this dream that has grown on me in the past few years, I’d have to eliminate one of my options, whether USP in Brazil or EPFL in Switzerland due to the amount of time set into both. 
While balancing my studies for the local admissions test(Fuvest-USP), the EPFL’s entrance exams in French, and a few EC’s, I obtained a couple of 1550+ scores at home following all the procedures as time-monitored tests. I judge my English as near-fluent since I have been taking classes since I was 9. Above all, I have a strong passion for physics, mathematics, and technologies(mainly AI related to physics research).
I also would be prone to take SAT II, and possibly AP exams, as well as the TOEFL to sum up with my 9.6 out of 10 GPA.
My main concern involves my financial background and my lack of extracurriculars related to my major of interest - math or physics with computer science.
I have participated weekly in two educational NFOs since I was in middle school and more recently online with administrative work, some calls, and at the end of the pandemic as a teacher, which I loved; I had acoustic guitar lessons in the same period mentioned until I started piano lessons one year ago; I have been taking English and French private lessons for 4 years; and played varsity state-level soccer, being the captain until the pandemic started. I acknowledge and feel this excitement for applied maths and physics pushing me to possibly pursue a career in academia and live I life I won't regret, however, I awfully believe that my extracurriculars aren't good enough for top 20 schools and I'm inclined to study in epfl where id have an amazing education, but entirely different from what I've expected as the holistic formation to some eclectic interests that I also have in history and art. 
Back to my financial means, I'm entirely grateful for the opportunities that I already have and a possible new pursuit would be limited to an investment of $25,000 per year from my parents. By converting my mother’s income to USD(~$35,000) we would qualify for 100% financial support from need-based universities, and those would be my goals.
My question is, am I a strong applicant for America’s A-1 universities undergrad or have I lost my chance by not investing in a passion project?",1

"I am going to apply this to my prep for the SAT, and if this works, I will be forever grateful for you. Thank you so much for helping students. You are seriously changing lives. The amount of stress that lifted from my shoulders is indescribable. I am hardworking as a student but I had no strategy to study, however this video told me exactly what to do. This helps more than you know! Thank you!",1

"This video is super helpful! A fantastic sequel to this would be 46 easiest SAT math problems because the easy ones show up more often, and you can still get them wrong if you use the wrong approach. I am not looking to get a perfect score. So, my goal is to focus on getting the easy/medium ones correct and salvage some of the more difficult ones. However, I know I am not the only one who is frustrated with getting 'easy' problems incorrect on the SAT. Therefore, this would be an excellent video for those looking to be in the 600-700 range for the math section, rather than 700-800.",1
thank you so much mann for going through all the sat sample papers solving each of them nd thus finding the hardest questions for us so that we can improve ourselves nd score the best. your efforts were so muh helpful for us. You really deserve a lot of applause and attention 👍🏻🔥❤️,1
Once again: You are the epitome of success. Thank you for making these videos! Hope you hit 100k during summer of 2021! You motivate and aspire me a lot!,1
"For ""Practice Test 3: Calculator, #25 | Volume Word Problems"" I'm seeing an easier way to find D without using the calculator. Volume of the cylinder is 250pi and volume of the two cones is 250pi/3. Total volume is 4/3(250pi) or 1000pi/3. pi is > 3 so the answer has to be bigger than 1000. D is the only answer bigger than 1000. Thanks for these awesome explanations!",1
"I really appreciate your effort, you went through each and every sample paper solved each of the questions and selected out the hardest questions for us. thank you 🙂",1

My very first time taking the SAT I get 23 wrong in the Writing Section. However, at khan academy, in the last practice test that I take, I'm getting 33 rights with frequency, which makes me really happy! After that video, I finally understood some keys concepts, such as semi-colons, which I'm sure can give me more 3,4 rights! I'm going to take my second, and last SAT on this saturday, so I'm studying hard to do well and get some financial aid. Thanks teacher, sure you had been helping a lot of teenagers, and now I'm one of them.

"Truly inspiring video. The presentation is truly flawless, and the few frames of Minecraft gameplay captures the essence of the game. I love how you used pocket edition, because its unique and different than most Minecraft videos being published today using PC or console versions of the game, and I really think this choice sets you away from the others and makes you stand out. Also the landscape presented in the few frames really captures the urgency of the situation and how you want to hold on to the game as long as possible before you give in to the urge to scratch your testicles. I really love the decision to be in a gray cobblestone base, as the gray really gives a feeling of sadness as you will only be able to play the game for so little time before needing to submit to the feeling of discomfort in your testicles only able to be relieved by scratching them. Also the choice to place torches in the shelter symbolizes the small time you have hope to keep going even though the situation seems tough and the darkness is surrounding. If you observe the items the player is holding during the gameplay, we can find that the player is holding a torch, just like the many around his shelter. This means the torches around the base has just been placed, and shows how you can move forward in life, no matter how dire the situation may seem. In the other hand you can find a stone sword which symbolizes the battle needed to resist the constant suffering of feeling a slight skin discomfort in the testicular area, and how much you can fight through it and do your best no matter what. Also the usage of a sword in shelter holds a really deep meaning, showing how even if someone is in their home, they are never safe of the dangers outside, and that they always should be careful and attentive of their surroundings to ensure their safety. I also appreciate the 4 chests in the form of a rectangular shape, which shows the balance of a mans possessions and how you need to hold on to all you have because you never know if something might happen requiring you to exit the software due to an unforgiving feeling in the balls. Not to mention the way the player looks out the exit, as if the player is looking out into the giant world around them, thinking of all they could accomplish and how they might get there, and how even though you may be small compared to the universe, the impact you make can change the world. Another very symbolic part of this film is the ending, where the player thanks everyone for viewing his video even though it took the viewer though a lot of ups and downs emotionally but they still stayed through to the end to show support for the player's dedication. It also is in a slightly smaller frame, and black bars replace the outer edges, which show that even though you try your best, there is still endless uncertainty on how your choices impacted your journey, and how much different it could have been if you have done something different, which creates a paradox of endless possibilities which could have spiraled out of one simple task of playing the game of Minecraft as long as possible, without itching ones testicles. The background is blue behind white text which shows how the creator felt ""blue"" or sad about ending, but still proud of what they accomplished, and is hopeful for what is to come.

A really poetic performance, really captures the ups and downs needed to be overcome in what seems to be a simple sandbox game can be dramatically multiplied with the added challenge of persevering through the hardships of avoiding the constant urge to scratch ones balls. I can't wait to see more work from you.

Binge-watching Mr. Beast is the only thing keeping me motivated in life  rn if that makes sense,1

This channel brings happy tears to my eyes.  Keep up the fantastic work!!!,1
Absolutely loved this video! Glad he got the teachers on it as well bc most classrooms are fully teacher funded bc the school only gives them $200 for classroom supplies and that is nowhere near enough for an entire school year. Teachers deserve the world 💙,1

He’s had them for 18 months. There’s no way of ever knowing who saw them or photographed them until they surface somewhere in the world. It’s the most dangerous action he did coz of course he will have shown/sold/used them for leverage.,0

The Federal government guarantees the education loans.  The lending institution and the university/college are not liable for any of the loans.  Thats the problem.,0
"This is great for some people but you really need to regulate the actual universities who are charging absurd amounts, and that'll get lobbied against hard by college corporations.",0
Remember it’s only federal loans and those parents with less than stellar credit scores could not get federal loans.,0

"As someone with the correct clearance I can vouch, just like so many of you, that this guy didn't keep them in a place that meets requirements for storage of such materials. Also, lying about all this  is quick dismissal from your clearance. I've seen people fail to get adjudicated for omission of one piece of information they thought wasn't important. One lost it for keeping in touch with their mother who is from China. Their contact with their mother caused them to lose their TS/SCI. Think about that. And this guy and his followers think he did nothing wrong?
The level of failures here by the former president shows he is ill-equipped to handle said documents.
Now it's just one excuse after another.
Day to day with the people who live in the real world of clearance all know that if we did 1% of what he did, we be effed.

Tobacco is almost all downsides and weed is almost all upsides. Hard to imagine anyone would prefer tobacco to cannabis.,0
"That's a good thing. And honestly it's probably been that way for a while, just that some people didn't fess up to it while it was illegal in their state. Plus some people get their nicotine fix from non tobacco sources now anyway, which wasn't really a thing until the past decade and a half.",1

"Personally, I think education (or, specifically, a lack thereof) is one of the strongest driving forces behind things like this -- because ignorance breeds fear and distrust, especially in things that are new or foreign.

When I was in elementary school, back in the 70's, I was reading my way through my school's sci-fi section. It was just a few shelves, but it had almost all the classics... Asimov, Bova, Bradbury, Campbell, Clarke, Doc Smith, Heinlein -- and then I got to Verne. I'd just finished up 30,000 Leagues and was getting into Journey to the Center of the Earth when I found a page had been ripped from the book.

Being a good student, I reported it to the Librarian... but instead of focusing on the missing page, she was outraged that I was reading this particular book. It was ""above my level"" she said, and ""too difficult"" for me. This was a hundred-year-old story at this point, and I was pretty sure it wasn't a difficult one to follow -- the movie was even one of my favorites every time it aired on Creature Feature on Saturdays! But she still took the book away... and over the next few weeks, that sci-fi section became empty shelves as she removed and locked away almost all the books there.

A short time later, I overheard her talking to another teacher about, of all things, a ""shooting star"" -- a meteor that many had seen a night or two before. The Librarian was mocking the teacher because ""a shooting star is impossible -- the Heavens are permanent! The stars don't move!"" As the teacher tried to explain the idea of a meteor, it seemed to both terrify and outrage her. And the longer that conversation went on the more even I (maybe 10 or 11 years old at the time?) realized -- the sci-fi books she had removed weren't above MY level, they were above HER level. She had no understanding of science, and all these sci-fi stories about starships, robots, and alien worlds were things that she just didn't understand... and because of that, they scared her, so she locked them away.

And unfortunately, it sounds like that sort of mindset hasn't changed all that much in the 40 or so years since then.",0
"Whenever I heard a book was banned from my school library, I would immediately check it out from the public library.  I learned a lot about menstruation from “Dear God, It’s Me Margaret” one summer.  I was 8, and completely traumatized when I realized it happens to my Mom too.  I’m not helping here….  My point being, more students will now read these books than before banning them.",0
"When one parent doesn't want their child to read a certain book they can fill out a form so no child in the school can read it. That sounds more like indoctrination than education. Instead of removing the book from the whole school they should just disallow that one student access to the book.  Sorry Johnny, you can't check out that book because your parents said so!",0

"""There's no accounting at his business.""??  IRS, ARE YOU LISTENING?
How could this possibly be true?",0
So he’s still lying about his intention. How much more could he possibly pay in light of the fact we know he’s still lying about this situation? Why do people follow him if they know he’s lying?,0
"Alex Jones defense might actually be brilliant. ""I didn't do it on purpose""

Look at the lawyer he hired, sent the prosecution all the evidence they needed. ""I didn't do it on purpose""

He lied under oath ""I didn't do it on purpose"".

I mean he's clearly guilty of torturing the victims of an elementary school shooting, his choosen defense is the only option that had at least a 1% chance of working.  (But ultimately him hiding his own money so he can declare bankruptcy defense is much stronger, the old white man defense)",0

"I love how you actually explain stuff instead of just shoving information into students' heads. I think that turns many students off about learning chemistry, since they're not understanding any of it and are just blindly memorising and accepting that things happen the way they do, without aksing why. If those students had you as a teacher, they'd be a much more interested in chemistry, as they'll understand that it's how we as a species study matter and the universe, and is not just a bunch of stuff to be memorised! Keep going, you're amazing <3",1

I sincerely appreciate you putting your knowledge on this youtube channel, I found you back a few months ago when I first started my class because I was so frustrated and went to youtube and I happened to find you. I don't understand why teachers don't explain things the way you do, you show us every step while other teachers skip steps and go way too fast. It makes me feel better about myself, because I failed chem class in high school, but have to take it in college to become a Nurse. You're beyond helpful and are impacting students in so many ways!! ill keep using as many of your videos as I can as i make my way through my chem class, you're amazing!!",1
You are literally the person who saved me from failing in chemistry. Our end of term is just a few days from now. Thank you sir!,1

Excellent work..! You are giving knowledge free to everyone.. You certainly accumulates lot of good karma.. may triple gem bless you for everything.. Keep it up..,1
"I had to comment under this video. I have my BS in math and when I tell you the way you taught these concepts were absolutely amazing. You did a great job in not only explaining the concepts but setting it up to where one can intuit all the components and and concepts that goes into the applications of it all. Thanks so much, I feel like I can really help my students with their digestion of these concepts and rationalization of it! Thanks you so much for taking the time to teach these concepts!",1

Thanks you for helping me and my students make this transition to online distance learning smooth and mostly painless.  


In addition, since I have found you to be such an excellent instructor (and parents and kids clash at times), I have you ""teach"" my 8 year old (2nd grade) multiplying and dividing fractions.  I then act as his tutor to explain concepts (such as negative numbers) that you introduce and clear up his confusion.  I find it works out so much better this way, because when I am both teacher and tutor to him his frustration level rises rapidly when he does not grasp a concept immediately.",1

"I can proudly say that I've gone through the whole video. I started in april 20th and with larger breaks due to final exams in school, I finished today on the 15th of may. I have learned so much important stuff! I will go to university for a bachelors degree in biology yet I haven't had chemistry and physics in over 3 years. Going through this content and studying it carefully is probably the only reason I feel comfortable to continue my journey to become a neuroscientist. Thanks :)",1

At 83, I'd like to believe that kids will always remain curious about the mathematical world.",1
"I love it! And I agree with what he said in the end. I became interested in mathematics (although not good at it) because of how amazing that when you solve numbers and equations, you will arrive to an answer that is related to what the universe offers.",1
"Maths is love ❤️ 
Thx for the insight bro 😎 
Very informative ✅",1
"I've been watching this video since the start of my journey. I come back here maybe once a year . 
It feels so good to have covered up some parts of this map. A dream I had when first seeing this",1
"This helped me so much, my friend who is a genius when it comes to school education and he used this to get a basic foundation of where I am so we know where to start, thanks so much, you gained another sub! Keep up the great work! (:
I know it’s a lot of work but I would love to make a very in depth video, one for each of the subjects you mentioned in this video!",1
The best! I'm understanding your online explanations more than my teachers at school...i recommended your channel to my friends and they're agreeing with me!! Thanks a ton😃,1
This video helped me to learn this lesson easily before the school's reopen. Thank you so much sir..,1
"Thanks a lot sir.
This video helped a lot to understand the balancing concepts. 😊👩‍🔬",1
"Amazing teaching sir!
I wish I had a teacher like you in my school.",1
Awesomely explained..Thanks a ton..No words to express our gratitude for such wonderful explanation..👍🏻,1
"The world needs so much more of the likes of you, Sir. I am lost for words to thank you. Your enunciation is great and your explanation is remarkable.",1
Thanks sir it's really understandable I enjoyed it,1
"Thank you, sir! You elaborated the topic well! Easy to understand, indeed.",1
I have been trying these equations for mobths you helped me out thanks alotttt sir. May god bless YOU,1
Thanks a lot sir actually I never understand that how to make equations and how to balanced them and in online classes everything is like going upwards from my head your video motivate me and give me an inspiration that chemistry is really not tough again Thanks a lot for such a wonderful video KEEP GOING KEEP GROWING!! 😌😌☺☺,1
great video,1
"The ""(Topic) in X minutes"" format seems fun, what (topic) would you want to see in the future?",1
That’s way faster than any teacher could ever hope to achieve.,1
"The DNA joke at the beggining, I actually laughed exactly like the audience, I started chuckling, then more, and then I bursted out laughing it was perfect",1
"In just 9 minutes and 30 seconds, I learned more than 8 hours of school.",1
"""fungi are like the weird cousin of plants and animals"" - ah yes, that weird cousin who has a habit of feeding off their relatives' corpses once they've died",0
"Man , I thought he was gonna explain all my 10 years of medical studies in 9 min , he didn't even touch the atom of the Galaxy",0
haven’t been to school in ten years and just re-enrolled in college. I need all the help I can get thanks for the video. its a good warm up lecture before I take my actual bio class,1
"Dude, thank you so much for providing this information for free on YouTube. I'm not a biology student ( amateur ), nor do I have anything to do with it, career wise, but I just like to have knowledge, and I watch your videos multiple times, and I still do. It's people like you and Sal khan from khan academy, that make this world a better place. I can learn anything I want, without going broke! Lol thanks once again.",1
"This dude is a very talented teacher :) You can feel his enthusiasm through his words and his teaching is very easy to learn from, ..I find :) it's rare to find!",1
Wow I think I just learned more here than in my actual bio class.,1
"Just want to say that your videos helped me get an A in my college Bio class, in the past. Thank you!",1
This is an excellent lesson and I love how the teacher explains it so it is easy and fun to learn.,1
"he's an awesome teacher, he explains very well",1
"Sir, thank you very much for posting this. I have learned a lot just by watching your video. I also took the important details on my notes so that I can review it. You are such an amazing professor just like my biology prof when I was in grade 12 who can explain everything in detailed and examples. By the way I am from the Philippines and I am having a college entrance exam this May 😭 Thank you again Sir for the series of video you've made for biology. I am currently watching them 😇",1
Wow never listened to a lecture where time felt like it went too fast... thank you!!,1
Thanks to sir because he teach lessons about biology and its pretty good because i incoming freshman this years Bs Biology. This is Helpful to all students like me.,1
Thanks!,1
"This video is educational art, it's much more stimulating than my physiology teacher's monotone PowerPoint lectures. Thank you so much!",1
5 weeks of online class radically explained in 7 minutes. Thank you so much!,1
This video was incredibly helpful for me. A video of 7:21 minutes literally covered the whole chapter of cell. Thanks a million <3,1
Incredibly helpful!! Thank you so much !! This is how we should learn  biology !,1
It proves that everything is interesting if it is taught in the right way,1
"Description + Imagery = Perfection 👌



No, really this is a perfect review for my organelles test for tomorrow. Great job, and thank you so much! 👍



Edit: Wow, I did not expect this so many likes, hehe.Thx.",1
Dude I can't thank you enough. This is the first time I have understood anything about cell and found it interesting. This is literally a game changer. Thanks a Lott!!!,1
"While I do enjoy my College Biology class, having this information in a visual format like this gave all that abstract lecture information something to stick to—thank you so much!",1
Don't be too hard on yourself about the drawing you presented: it really did help me understand things a lot better!  And thank you for the video - you are so clear and concise - you are helping me a lot!,1
"4:03 no problem my guy, what's important is how you teach, fantastic work, I really loved it how you explained every single detail. Keep up the great job",1
Your video is far more effective than my bio teacher's whole year lecture,1
"Oh man. There he goes. Smacking open the biology can. 

At this rate he will have his own school soon. 

Keep it up!",1
"thank you so much sir! I appreciate your hardwork for the sake of many students having a hard time to understand their subjects, especially physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology and etc. May God bless you and your family.",1
Thank you so much for all of your help with everything.  I am taking biochemistry and genetics right now. Praying to find more videos that you can help me out with these classes. Love the way you teach.,1
Thanks!!! you really helped me form a background understanding of cells and made me prepare for my upcoming Biology class.😁,1
This guy really helps me through my med classes! im glad i bumped into your videos. you make complex topics so easy to understand!,1

Biology Made Ridiculously Easy | 1st Edition | Digital Book : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCgu2VX7zyY,1
Just started watching today. Everything seem so clear now! Looking forward to other videos!,1
Thank you for helping beginners understand science. God bless.,1
"Keep going guys, you are doing an awesome job 😁👍",1
"very brief and interesting video.
I shall share it with my students.
look forward to watching more videos like this.",1
I like how this video is narrieted its more engaging!Great work!😁,1
Awesome understanding explanation of BIOLOGY 😇💙,1
"Nice video, can you let me know which tool did you use to make this great video? Thanks :)",1
"A virus interacts with its environment, uses energy and reproduces, but viruses are argued to be not living organisms. Maybe this is because they can't independently reproduce, they require the cellular machinery of the host cell to manufacture new viruses.",0
"Love it
I fell in love with all videos 😍",1
"If you liked the video and want to see more like this here are some things you can do to make sure it happens:
👉🏻 Share the video
👉🏻 Check out Nebula & Curiosity Stream
👉🏻 Like and Comment",1
"Having done a lot of diving - I can say that the octopus is an absolute marvel to encounter. Some (mostly the younger ones) are ... So curious. At first it's like ""WOW! U THREAT?!"" once it establishes that you are not, it's like ""Eeer ... What are you then? I've never seen one of you around before."" and there begins the act of mutual curiosity :3. You slowly reach with a finger, it sends a tentacle ... you both touch, sometimes they get frightened and clamp your entire hand, flashing black before letting go, but not swimming away. They are playful, find a shiny pebble, hand it to the octopus, it'll take it, check if it can be eaten ... discard it ... then a few sec after send a tentacle back to the pebble out of curiosity as to ""why did he give me this pebble ... gotta check again for anything special"". They really hold a very special place in my heart, it's not everyday that two species get curious about one another and attempt mutual understanding :)",1
"My favorite creature ever.  I was on a crab ship in Russia.  I was the green horn so I had to empty out the pots.  I was also making hooch quietly because it was forbidden (it was lighting in a cup) so I could swap liquor with the chef for him making me private meals.  One day there was an octopus in a crab pot.  I tossed it a live well. Came back once everyone was off the deck.  Was gonna take it to the chef. it softly wrapped itself around my arm and I felt like I could see the fear in its eyes.  I couldn't do it.  I took it over to the side of the ship, held it over.  It looked down, looked back at me, let go of my arm, and worked its way down the side of the ship until it got to the water.  AMAZING CREATURES!",1
"I can genuinely say I have never been more astounded by another being on this planet.  The evolution of this beautiful creature is literally out of this world.  This video left such an imprint on me that being able to ""pet,"" play, handle, or be in close graces of this animal are on my life's bucketlist for sure.  Being apart of research and doing a 180 degree career change may be in my future.",1
"You know, in our hunt for intelligent life in space, it's heartwarming and humbling to know there are other creatures on this planet other than humans who very well in the distant future, could eventually be seen as a higher intelligence.",1
"One of the most amazing species of Octopus is the Mimic Octopus, it not only uses it's shape changing skin and camouflage to hide but also imitates other sea life both as a way to escape predators (when being chased by a damselfish it'll make itself look like a banded sea snake, which is a damsel fish predator) but also to hunt (imitating a crab to draw in another crab). The list of animals it's been observed to imitate is quite long (Jelly Fish, Lionfish, Sea Snakes, Zebra Sole, Flatfish, Giant Crab, Sea Horses ect) it has also been recorded imitating at least two species we don't know about (the same shape were recorded in separate locations being used by different individuals).",1
I feel that this is a great place to recommend the book Children of Ruin - it depicts a society of octopuses that were subject to a virus which causes accelerated evolution and the struggle of humans to communicate with them. Some of the best sci-fi I've read.,1
I love how Wired always finds people that are super passionate about their careers. Always the icing on the cake for me.,1
"I love this guy. He's so charismatic, has wonderful speech patterns, and explains things so well.",1
As a biology major this video made me feel sad for not having great professionals as passionate to their jobs as this man!,0
"His enthusiasm is so contagious, and he makes biology sound so interesting. This was awesome, thank you, Wired!",1
I love the way he talks with such enthusiasm but in a calm way that’s inviting and makes you want to learn,1
"This man brought half of his office with him just to show us the most details, so humble and kind",1
this guy is so fascinating. i love him. he’s so passionate about what he teaches and i love it. i’m sure his students are so grateful for him. he showed us so much cool stuff,1
"thor used to give talks at my tiny little elementary school in the pnw, genuinely one of the smartest and most passionate people i have ever met in my life (and yes, he brought this many props for presentations, too)",1
This dude needs a podcast his voice is calming and intellectual at the same time,1
"""i'm allergic to penicillin and azithromycin""  -  round of applause for the parents",0
"People: i just don’t think people should be able to use it for cosmetic purposes 

Scientists: bold of you to assume we know how to do that.",0
His body language says a lot about him he's very ambitious willing to share and learn more but also he's really competitive,1

"The number of times I've heard ""we don't know"" and ""partially understood"" gives me hope for science.",1
This is amazing and really interesting. I  got so lost  because I have insufficient scientific education  to follow this completely but it is fascinating to me and  I really enjoyed this video. I  have saved it and will play it over and over again to try and  understand it. I love the humor and the  very clear way they are trying to explain this to the layman. It is wonderful that they have this on youtube so we can all explore this amazing subject.,1
"I just want to say that I absolutely love this. I'm both mind-blown, entertained and inspired. As a mere psych student I still feel like I understood a whole lot of it, and they even made some psych references. And the way they talked about children having an intuitive understanding of quantum stuff made me think of theory-theory and this quote: ""It's not that children are little scientists — it's that scientists are big children.""",1
This was a phenomenally moderated session. Serious kudos to John.,1
"I am very thankful for this presentation, I was afraid I was the only one that was pondering these ideas specifically concerning microbiology. Specifically the ability of bacterium changing their polarity quickly through chemical absorption of charged ions that are easily available through their outer cell wall causing that microbe to move, in a since, chemically. That would explain the speed of its movement as if turning on and off a light. In effect, just by changing of polarity of a biome would move it through time and space while leaving it's structure idle, at its point of origin, but alter the quality of a distant biome into the parent's original quality. In this accomplishing the  quantum speeds. Said energy in itself could then be transferred into movement, pressure fluctuation to force fluid movement or constriction, as well as color change. We see this in octopus or the movement of photophilic  plant cells. Great  discussion.",1
"I just started enjoying watching this with closed captioning but 20 minutes in, it stopped working. I hope this can be fixed so I can watch the whole segment. Absolutely loved what was mentioned already so far. Thank you all for putting this together!",1
Thank you so much for this video. Very helpful for a biology teacher like me.,1
I remember being only able to see content like this on the Discovery Channel. It's crazy that I can watch content like this (arguably waaay better) at anytime and not being glued to my TV. Brilliant.,1
"I use to be in the army. I can remember in training, the endless patrols through the woods.
But the dragonflies were our friends. You’d see them gliding back and forth just over our heads, catching the mosquitoes which swarmed around us. 
It was impossible for the dragonflies to get all the mosquitoes, but it was a comfort to know we had allies out there in those woods.",1
I once was kayaking with my father in Florida when I took a break from rowing a beautiful dragonfly landed on the end of my ore. About 12 seconds of me gawking at it went by before a bigger dragonfly landed on top of the first and proceeded to quickly rip its head off. After it decapitated my new found friend it took off with the body leaving the head sitting on my ore with my jaw on the floor in total shock of what murder I had just witnessed. That day I learned that Dragon flies are metal as fuck.,0
"That was probably one of the more intelligent ""clicks"" I've chosen in a while. Thank you for sharing and creating that incredible video! Now I absolutely have an even deeper appreciation for dragonflies than I already did. 😄🙌🏼🐲✈️🦋",1
I once found a cold dragonfly who couldn't move. I put it into diret sunlight and it warmed and flew away. I'm glad to have been of help.,1
"This was one of the best documentaries I’ve ever seen. Perfect organization, perfect visuals, extremely high information content… Well done, and thank you!",1
"When I was growing up in the countryside in Japan, dragonflies were everywhere.
I could catch them with my fingers sometimes.
Of course I let them go quickly but some of the kids put thread on them so they wouldn't fly away.
Those were the days...  now I don't see many dragonflies anymore.
Thank you so much for sharing the wonderful fact about them!",1
"I've seen a dragon fly with 6 wings once. I was floating down a river and it was flying near me and then landed on me for a short time. All of the wings worked. A cool mutation, I wonder how rare it is. Wish I had a camera with me",1
"What intelligence to be able to skillfully control those beautiful wings! About 22 years ago, my husband and I stopped by a large creek to meditate. As I opened my eyes, a group of five dragonflies that were traveling over the water suddenly stopped in front of my face, hovered there for about 10 seconds, then suddenly did a 90 degree turn in synchronized fashion and continued on their way down the creek. It was otherworldly. I’ll never forget it. Thank you for this excellent content!",1
"The counter-balance to deal with aerodynamic flutter is some really incredible biomechanics. I've seen videos of flutter being tested on airplanes and it's no joke, that can quickly ruin your day.",0
"with the current acceleration of Breakthroughs in science, I wish this was like a monthly thing it would be awesome to get updated by these great videos.",1
Truly interesting to learn that sleep isn't restricted to organisms with a brain.,1
Quanta Magazine always does a brilliant job at condensing scientific discoveries for a wider audience. I love what you do.,1
I was waiting for this. This blew my mind. Gotta wait for the physics and math one. !!! There are so much to tell!!! Great work!,1
"I’ve been keeping my eyes on my subscriptions just in case Quanta Magazine posts this year’s science break through and it’s finally here! Great episode as usual, I’m also excited for the maths and physics ones!

And thank you Quanta Magazine for your great work!",1
"I just completed my first year if psychology and neuroscience at university! Scientists are learning new things about the brain all the time, it’s super cool",1
"And if you haven’t had enough ocean creature facts for one day, head over to listen to our new podcast episode “Deciphering the Mind of the Octopus” on Nebula. It will take you behind the scenes on what it’s like to take care of these mischievous animals. This is probably my favorite episode yet!  https://nebula.app/modulus",1
"""The most fearsome predator of the sea, Sharks"" ...

The Orca, literally torturing other animals for fun: ""Am I a joke to you?""",0
"That footage of the finless shark plummeting to the sea floor was appalling. I'm incredibly glad you showed it, but it's appalling. I'm not outright against the killing of animals, but the combination of outright cruelty and waste is just mind bending. I struggle with how humans can so easily disconnect from certain realities (I struggle with how I see it in myself as well). A fisherman would know that these sharks would still be alive when they're thrown back in, if they just stopped to even think about what they're doing. If they're hellbent on wasting the rest of the shark, just slit the damn thing's throat before you throw it back, you sick fuck",0
"It’s really interesting to think about how, an animal that has been around for literally million of years just out of the blue made a species so different from the rest and out of the ordinary, yet it ended up being very complex and enhanced from the norm",1
Awesome work! Love the video! Thank you for what you do!,1
"Hammerheads are amazing...  Years ago, while trolling off the coast of Florida, I encountered one...  I was headed due south, and we spotted it heading aproximately SE.  Fin out the surface, big fella...  But we were on an intercept course.  He came to within ~100 ft of the boat, then turned off to the west.  He circled around, well behind our baits, and resumed his original course.  I swear he had GPS.",1
"Your speech at the end of this video really struck me. It makes me so happy to hear someone able to take their dream and make it a reality! Both your channel and Real Engineering are two of my favorites for interesting and niche technology and science, and I am always excited to see a new video :) THANK YOU for being you and sharing what you care about to the rest of the world.",1
The technical side of this video and this channel is truly impressive. Have to admit the fact they are providing free useful scientific information with such a great quality. A very big thanks for the people behind this channel ❤️😄🙏,1
Check out even more from Thor! >> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgEYV2s8Pg4,1
"Every time he answers its like he's telling us a story, rather than regurgitating an answer. I could listen to him all day.",1
Give this guy his own animal documentary series like a more chill Bill Nye. His explanations are like a little story and you don't make anyone feel bad about their questions. Bravo this was one of the most entertaining biology videos I have watched in awhile,1
"Came for the biology facts, stayed for his infectious positivity. His energy alone is more of a dopamine hit than anything else has been all day.",1
How on earth does WIRED get the professionals who are literally the most passionate people on the planet?,0
He seems VERY passionate about Biology. The way that he explains these things makes it seem like he really loves his job. I admire people who can be passionate about their jobs.,1
"Not only is he crazy passionate and knowledgeable about biology, he's also called Thor. How much cooler can this guy get??",1
"""the plant is deadly, deadly *toxic* :D ""

Lmao I love this guy. His enthusiasm is contagious, keep bringing him back!",1
he is the type of biology teacher that would be able to easily hold the attention of any classe just by the way he speaks so excited about things,1
"As someone obsessed with biology, I'm pretty disappointed that the Map of Biology received the least views of all the sciences :'(",0
"I've been waiting forever for this one. Although I'm biased by being a biochemist myself, he did an amazing job at bringing all the branches together in a smooth, non-confusing way! I would like to see a map of medicine or linguistics in the future.",1
"Awesome job with this maps (And all the others too) :) Which will be the next map?
Map of Philosophy
Map of Engineering
Map of Psychology",1
"this is helping me understand what parts of biology i like, and therefore helping me choose my education! thank you for a very informational video",1
"I love your maps, they are fantastic!  Thank you for putting them together, they are super helpful.  One nitpick - what about Microbiology?  This is a VERY important subject, given that unicellular microorganisms vastly outnumber the multicellular organisms most people are familiar with.  Of course, I may be biased, since I am a microbiologist...anyway, keep up the great work!  I am blown away by the breadth of your knowledge, and have learned a ton about scientific fields I am less familiar with through your work.",1
"Love the Kurzgesagt reference at 3:02
Can you do the map of astronomy next?",1
"I love these Maps so much, they are pure gold!
Philosophy I imagine is very tough to make but would be extremly awesome too",1
"These videos are good but I have two minor criticisms of this one:

1. Structural biology is concerned with the structure of large macromolecules. Amino acids are all small molecules so they fall more under the purview of biochemistry. Your description is almost verbatim one of the sentences from the opening paragraph of the Wikipedia page on structural biology, but I don't think that's correct.

2. Biomedical engineering is the field that makes artificial organs and other medical devices. Biotechnology uses living organisms or their products for our purposes. Synthetic biology creates synthetic organisms and is closely related to biotechnology, but the latter two fields aren't closely related to the first.",0
This dude is getting me through college one video at a time.,1
"My earphones get tangled all the time, but miles and miles of DNA don't. Mind blowing.",0
"I started teaching biology in 1993 and I KNOW my kids (now middle aged) KNOW it was Rosalind Franklin who did the work. Hank, thank you. I left teaching, but am thinking about getting back into the classroom. Using your videos to study up for the test to get recertified. :)",1
"Thank you so much for covering Rosalind Franklin, some of my previous instructors only briefly mention her and they rarely discuss her major contributions to the discovery of the DNA structure.",1
"""why is a teenage boy similar to helicase?
they both want to unzip your genes (grins)""
I'm speechless",0
"I don't remember Crash Course being this complicated when I was in 9th grade biology, though I guess I should be thankful that 6 years later it is still helpful for my college level genetics class.",1
"Editing team:   ""Hank please hold up a shoelace and be amazed by it""",1
"For the first time in my two years in college, I actually understand what I am seeing. Thank you. I am in the MLT program trying to understand how PCR testing works but in order to do that I realized that I REALLY need to comprehend DNA and how it is made in order to understand how it is taken apart and analyzed. You have really given me a strong visual and I can't thank you enough.",1
"honestly, Its crazy how much easier information is retained when you voluntarily seek it. When i was in school i would have never listened to this and would have been dying to get out of there. Now that i have the ability to learn on my own time I retain and look for information on a much higher level. Incredible.",1
"This professor is wonderful, I’ve been in a lot of lectures and the way he immediately captured my attention, held it, injected humor, and made me like him- was fantastic. Intro to human behavior indeed.",1
I really hope that Professor Sapolsky knows how many people all over the world he captures through the screen with his amazing ability to teach 🙌,1
The fact that we can access this lecture without having to attend Stanford is mind-blowing. What a time to be alive!,1
"I'm literally in middle school yet I'm able to follow this to an extent, really makes it obvious that this professor's great at his job",1
I'm so grateful for living in an era where this kind of content is available like this. I'm from Brazil and I wouldn't be able to listen to this amazing classes if Stanford and professor Sapolsky weren't so kind to make it available online. Thank you.,1
"Coming back on that lecture, you're an absolute gem Robert Sapolsky. I've discovered this video a year ago, searched my way through the infite possibilities of life, finally started my bachelor in psychology, and I head on becoming a researcher in evolutionary psychology or something like that if things go well and if I still like it. Hopefully I see you some day at Stanford University",1
This is an absolutely amazing lecture because he doesn't just dive into the subject. He outlines the way to approach it without thinking in boxes. Its a refresher for scientific and critical thinking abilities. Designed to help unravel a very complex and challenging subject. I think I'm going to be spending some quality hours here with the Dr. One of his lectures on KoKo the gorilla brought me to this playlist.,1
The fact that baby orcas have to learn their language shows how intelligent these beings are,1
the fact that whales/dolphins can legally just be kept at places like Seaworld is just insane given just the information in this video.,0
21:50 It's really fascinating to see the Orca's movements in front of the mirror. They move with this careful consideration and grace that you also see in species like the dolphin or gorilla. Or humans for that matters.,1
"When I was a kid, I was a given a plush orca that immediately became my best friend
It wasn't until years later that I found out that orcas are actually fearsome beasts that sat at the top of the oceans' food chain 
and honestly I just fell in love with them even more",1
One of the coolest things to me about orcas that the video doesn’t mention is that there has never been a recorded human death from a wild orca. But orcas have been recorded and seen leading humans towards pods of whales to hunt. They might see humans as a potential symbiotic relationship since they’re known to eat human leftovers from whaling or snag stray fish when fishermen use nets. Just super cool that they easily could attack and kill humans but seemingly have no interest in doing so,1
"The Lummi Nation refer to the local orcas as Qwe 'lhol mechen, which means 'our relatives who live under the sea' or 'the people under the waves.' Orcas live in tight-knit families. In most cases, both males and females stay in their natal pod throughout their entire lives (this is especially true for Southern and Northern Residents). Orcas are incredibly intelligent and social. Their limbic system (the part of the brain that processes emotion) is incredibly developed and complex. Each pod uses a distinctive dialect to communicate. They're the only species, besides humans, pilot whales, beluga whales and narwhals, that go through menopause.

Famous Southern Resident orcas (fish eaters) : Lolita, Granny, Ocean Sun, Tahlequah (who made worldwide headlines when she was spotted carrying her dead calf for 17 days), Moby Doll, Shamu, Luna (there's a documentary about Luna called The Whale)

Famous Northern Resident orcas (fish eaters) : Namu, Corky, Tsitika, Eve, Sharky, Top Notch, Springer (the only orca to have been successfully re-integrated back into the wild)

Famous Transient orcas (mammal-eaters) : Lonesome George, Fatfin, Chainsaw, Esperanza, Sidney and her children, Raksha and her five daughters",1
I remember watching Black Fish and hearing one of the sailors sent to capture the first set of Orca calves remark about how when getting the calves in the boats the vocalizations they heard made them realize they were taking a baby and that its family was crying because of it. Really unnerving information for a college student aiming to become a scientist,0
"Orcas really are the humans of the sea. They're everywhere, eat anything, work in groups, have dialects, pass down skills over generations, and have great teamwork skills. If they were humans I would say they are in a sort of ""tribal stage."" It's only a matter of time before they become advanced one way or another.",1
"I love that seafaring mammals evolved out of the ocean, were unimpressed with the land, and just went back.",1
What a dream it would be to be able to actually communicate to orcas at some point. Communicating with other intelligent species is so huge,1
"HOWDY HO PEEPS! We’ve a new track and a music video out with our friends nublu & Gameboy Tetris. They’re some of our favourite vocal gurus in the whole world. We’ve been wanting to do something together for a while now and here it is. Also thanks to our amazing friends in the video crew for making the song come alive visually! We had an awesome weekend driving around Estonia partying with our friends. We got to see nublu faceplanting from the top of a monster truck, almost got Joosep killed with a golf club, Ago set his guitar on fire, Gameboy grilled us food on some bricks etc. Enjoy Coca Cola! ❤️🤠❤️ PS: Lyrics below!",1
Nice songs🔥,1
It just gets even better the more you listen!,1
"Cartoon is so underrated, But i am happy that only we a chosen few know about these gems.",1
This is a true brothership! Awesome video and song.,1
Worth every minute I listened. I am not either a scientist or a researcher. I am just the average Joanne who is so grateful that there are enquiring minds always striving to know more,1
"This lecture just flew by — always a good sign (for me) and kept me interested throughout — thanks. Love how seemingly unrelated events/discoveries lead to more investigation, experimentation and discovery. Reminds me of that great BBC series Connections.",1
That alien analogy works well in every branch of science....what a wonderful way to establish a context for such an engaging lecture...thank you,1
"To visually see, the smallest machines working in a living cell is a wonderment.  The smallest machines in the cell exhibit intelligence and decision making.  To actually see them in action in real time is astonishing.",1
"Very well done. I liked your analogy with football (soccer) and the microscope to start. As you went on I got more interested and I had to buy the book to learn more. Although I am not a scientist of cells, I am a scientist of knowledge, so your book will add to my knowledge base and maybe a breakthrough for me in certain aspects of my domain.",1
The start was excellent. A good metaphor! Maybe it's the way we understand the world around us. And the way we learn any subject! Thanks for sharing!,1
"This was absolutely fascinating! One of the best lectures on YouTube ever; well presented, very enthusiastic, knowledgeable and informative. I look forward to making my choices in the future. (I think!) The quote at the end was superb.",1
Thank you for this lecture. I'm still amazed about origin of those tools.,1
"Brilliant! Great presentation!
The future is going to be exciting and scary at the same time. 
Great technology seems to get weaponized asap in our world.
Thank you!",1
Bought two as a present for my wife. They're interesting little animals and a lot more intelligent than I would have thought. They recognize my wife as the one who feeds them; when she walks in the room they come to the front of the tank and start swimming up and down to get her attention. If someone told me they do that never would have believed them.,1
I'm from Mexico and it kills me to see that one of our national treasures is dying off. Also feel very much impotent at the fact that I can't do much about it. :c,0
I have an axolotl currently and he’s been with me since 2000 or 2001.  And he wasn’t a newborn when I received him.  Believe it or not.  He is definitely a god in the amphibian world at least.,1
"While really interesting, I can't help but feel bad for all the Axelotl that had to endure amputation and maybe worse for this to be researched. Especially the one that got their rejuvenation blocked.",0
I spent 20 minutes watching a bunch of cute salamanders while learning about them you earned a sub,1
"Learning about scientists finding a new home literally made me choke up. Axolotls are my favorite animal and I try to support any conservation organization centered around them as much as I can. They are such beautiful and magnificent creatures, and Im so happy they have been in the limelight more often these days. I truly hope their wild population can begin flourishing again :,)",1
"I cut off tip of my thumb and it regrew.  I was told it was because i retained nail bed which produces stem cells.  It was incredible process.  There was nothing to stitch shut (no skin) and couldn't reattach tip so they used a special material on it for a while.  Removing that was horrifying.  But there isn't even any scar tissue and my finger print grew back too.  However the nerves didn't fair quite as well.  It has that asleep pins and needles feeling to it so i did physical therapy to get used to fine motor tasks, and it's pretty much normal now.  I wonder if animals new limbs have less sensitivity too though 🤔",0
"My 10yo daughter loves axolotls. I don’t know why I’m being particularly emotional from this video, but it has really made me cry. I’m going to look and see what digital adoptions there are for axolotls. My daughter has a birthday coming up and a good gift would be a sponsorship in her name. She’s just a bit too young to keep one herself; maybe in high school if she’s still into it.",1
"My teacher literally does this: Shows Powerpoint, stays on a slide for like 10 seconds, says ""memorize this""  then moves on. Repeat like x10 everyday. This. Is. A. Lifesaver. Thank you.",1
All the dislikes are the students that had to take notes on this for biology,0
POV ur teacher sent u hear then u got bored now ur reading comments,0
Really like how you guys explain the major points in a fun and entertaining way. : ),1
You have earned another subscriber! This is both educational AND funny! You have a very unique way explaining things! This is VERY useful for any science tests or quizzes I have ahead! :),1
Can you make videos about the structures of each Macromolecule? It would help me to better understand the differences in them. Thanks! You are the Best!!,1
5 years old content and still helping to educate us students. Thanks!,1
The world needs more documentaries like this. More Bill Nye as well!,1
POV:You were drawing in science class while they played this video so now you’re struggling with the worksheet alone,0
It’s kind of crazy how cells are so small.,0
Great Documentary,1
Good documentary!,1
"What I find most interesting of all of this is how the underlying mechanisms for carnivory are rooted-pun intended-in the genomes of many plants, since they're usually used for defense against pathogens and herbivorous insects. With how common knowledge carnivorous plants are, it really surprises me that they aren't used as examples of how evolution works with what it has. Also, makes one realise how plants are very much alive and ""aware"" of the world surrounding them",1
Loved this video! I have always found carnivorous plants fascinating had had several venus flytraps. But I didn´t know how they actually worked or evolved. Thank you for the video ^^,1
"Yes, an “Insane Biology of” carnivorous plants! I’m an amateur CPs grower on my free time and a fan of the channel, it’s the perfect combination. Though on 1:38, aren’t waterwheels’ (aldrovanda) traps also snap traps? I believe bladderworts (utricularia) are the ones with suction traps.",1
Woh I can't wait to learn about the biology of venus fly traps so I can genetically engineer my own carnivorous plants,1
You’re awesome. I find real engineering’s content interesting but it’s yours which inspires me to become a genetic engineer,1
"600 species of carnivorous plants? Wow! And how did I never know that Venus Fly Trap & Pitcher Plants were both native to the US, I had always assumed they were exotic tropical plants. This was a fascinating & informative video 👍",1
"Thank you so much for answering this question! I knew that it was a nitrogen poor environment that drove the evolution of carnivorous plants, but the specifics of how their DNA changed to do so was always a mystery! And now, I will go eat some bacon.",1
"Ants are truly insane! 
Did you know that wood ants even sacrifice their own lives to save their colony? The territorial battles that break out between neighboring anthills each spring are warfare of the highest order, involving thousands of casualties and chemical weapons. Our film team was thrilled when they watched two colonies how they conduct scouting expeditions and subdue their enemies.",0
Aren't they awesome?! True rulers of the Earth! Ant love forever! ❤🐜🐜🐜 PS - Hate to be that guy but the creatures at 0:38 are actually termites. Not your fault; whoever catalogued that footage thought they were ants. I've seen the exact stock footage used in tv shows and videos about ants.,1
"Dude where did this amazing channel come from
Absolutely flawless sound design, script and editing",1
It's very impressive how much stock footage they were able to find on ants.,1
"I love that even the indigenous people from Australia, who already deal with tons of weird animals, were like: ""Nah this little guy is too weird to be normal.""",0
platypuses are one of the coolest animals alive. I'm surprised we haven't hunted this thing to extinction yet,1
The echidna just walking around is absolutely freaking adorable,1
When a high Youtuber explains biology better in 12 minutes than sober qualified teacher does in 12 weeks.,1
John green taught me books can make me even more depressed than I thought and Hank Green made me realize biology is cool which inevitably made me realize I want to be a forensic scientist. Thank you Hank,1
I just wanted to thank y'all at Crash Course for this biology series!! Last year I had to take a state biology test that is a part of a series of tests that are mandatory to pass to get your high school diploma. I decided to watch these biology vids to help prep because I wasn't feeling prepared enough. It ended up that a big section of the test was on a topic we didn't go over in class but I had watched Crash Course vids about it. Anyway I just recently found out that I did pass my test!!!! So just thank you guys so much!! I don't know if I would've made it through my test if it wasn't for these vids!!!😃😃👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻,1
"I love the way you teach.  I have ADHD and can never pay attention so thanks for being weird and not boring like most professors . With my ADHD , it affects me remembering things. I want to actually know and learn this subject and other subjects and not just memorize for the test then forget everything a month later. Any advice on studying or other tips to really keep the info embedded in my mind??",0
My AP Bio teacher took an ENTIRE week to teach us this... and you (a drunk man) taught it to me in 12 minutes!! Amazing,1
I just catched up with the whole year of 9th grade and I have never understood chemistry this good. Thank you!,1
"Great way to get ahead so I can make it into honors bio. Crash course is absolutely fantastic. It's essentially free school. And better school too! It's gets to the point and isn't all information. Its fun, quick, and educational. You've done something amazing here, Hank!",1
You're awesome. Thank you for making biology more accessible,1
"Pierre changed his whole production style, too many people copying his beats",0
"Pierre deserves every bit of success he gets. He uplifting so many artists’ careers, it’s time he gets recognized for how versatile he can be behind the mic. Congrats Pierre!💯🟣🏁",1
this song was well produced. everytime i hear it it puts me in one of the highest times of my life. it has a permanent happy effect on me. hotels. money. bitches.. good tree and tequila.. sunrises.. long nights..,1
"Pierre... You truly changed my life with your sound. Ever since my junior year of HS when my brother played Doublemint in the car I have been attached to your music. Since then, I have had memories with every song that you dropped. I just want to thank you for finally dropping this album and continue to do you and make/release your music. 💜🏁",1
I hate how underrated this man is but I lowkey like it at the same time .,0
i was alive when this man made music,1
Slap's like an abusive relationship,0
This by far the best song on the album,1
The insane biology series is so much cooler than the insane engineering series,1
"This is one of the best channels on youtube for sure. What an in-depth video on electric eels, it's fascinating what complex creatures they are. I mean remotely controlling their prey is just next level stuff. imagine what else is out there",1
"I absolutely adore this series of insane biology,
The long videos and high quality content,
Keep it coming!",1
"It's shocking, how your videos are so consistently amazing! I would say this is the best series of videos, I know of on youtube. There's the whole rest of the channel however, that's just as good.",1
"Genuine question: During the experiment with the dead fish, how did the eel knew the fish responded to its doublet when there was an agar barrier between them placed there to particularly impede the electric shock. You mentioned the eel's eyesight is poor and they rely heavily on their electrolocation of prey. Answers are appreciated. Thanks!",0
"Omg that little comment at the end about Texas' electric grid had me gagged lol (I live in Texas and experienced the utter failures of the February 2021 winter storm). I love these videos so much and even just a passing mention of the electricity crisis here by anyone is something that makes me very happy to hear. Keep up the awesome videos, they are very much loved and appreciated!",1
"Such depth and intricacies when it comes to the discussions

Kudos to this
I'm learning and I'm loving it
😍",1
Really appreciate this series for both the entertainment and how scientifically backed everything is.  I had no idea they were the inspiration for voltaic cells and the remote control before an attack.  So cool!,1
"i had the incredible luck of being roxy's classmate in university, and coworker through some crazy jobs :) she is one of the best artists i have ever met, and a truly top notch person and friend <3 thank you for highlighting her amazing work!! isn't it cool as hell?",1
"Has there ever been any speculative evolution of the octopus? I would very much like to see that! Since there have already been xenobiologists who have described the rise of octopus since they have massive amounts of neurons (e.g. throughout the animal, including each leg, which has the ability to feel, taste and smell) it is known that they have a great degree of intelligence from using that different type of ""brain."" They already have their own video channels such as 'Octolab' etc, but I remember someone showing drawings of octos swinging through trees.

I'd dearly love to see these creatures advance thru the eons!",1
"An animal evolving a foam-like cover instead of fur is such an interesting and original concept, goddamn. Now imagine if those foam glands slowly made the foam more firm. Over millions of years, the glands adapt. Eventually the foam glands evolve into something similar to hair follicles that produce very soft bulbs of keratin.

We now have frog sheep made of cloud bubbles. This sounds like such an adorable fairy tale but also oddly possible in real life",1
"I’m sorry. But I laughed every time you said “greater moist boy.” Every time. 
This was another great speculative world! And I liked that it was an alternate history of our own planet. The last few videos have taken us to some truly insane alien worlds, which I have LOVED, but it always feels nice to come back home and speculate about our own pale blue dot, and all the ways it could have turned out differently. I love your channel so much.",1
"The speculative world ruled by decapods such as crabs, lobsters, hermit crabs and shrimp seems interesting considering how diverse they are",1
"One thing about the inhabitated lodge: given its a desert animal (I think) it would make more sense if its tadpoles inhabit its back. A protected reservoir seems tl be good for tadpoles in a water poor enviroment.
 And given how beecomb frogs already carry their eggs/tadpoles in Chambers of there belly, this would feel like a nice nod to this real animal.
In addition this could be a way to get ""mammalian"" or ""placentalian"" amphibians of sorts, if it would continue to evolve along this line",1
"I love these what if speculative documentaries! I love the ideas of what if some animals were the dominant species. Friggin love the Moist Bois and the Freeple.
My favorite idea is a cephalopod world. In the game Splatoon, the lore is people died to a massive war and sea life took hold. It's kinda hinted their evolution was rapid due to either radiation, science gone wrong, or the lack of mammalian predators. So I wonder what a squid or octo world would be like. Would both evolve simultaneously like the Inklings and Octolings did? Would civilization rise again? I dunno, I wonder what a realistic Splatoon world would be where sealife, specifically invertebrates, evolved.",1
He literally explained a two hour long lesson in 15 minutes im shook,1
Let me just say: God bless this brilliant man and his brother for teaching topics in 10-15 minutes that teachers needed weeks for. No offense teachers.,1
"It has been eight years since this video was uploaded. I watched it for the first time about four or five years ago, when I was in high school. I prepared for the biology exam by these videos. I wathced this course when I was on the first year of medical university. And now I'm watching it again. I'm already finishing the third year and I teach biology scholars who, like myself some time ago, are about to enroll a med university. This is awesome. Thank you, Hank, and thanks to all of the CrashCourse team for this truly the greatest course of biology ever made.",1
"This really helps! My teacher only lectures and she skips a lot because we ""are already supposed to  know it"" and we are expected to know 10x the information she actually gives us.",1
I keep on getting med school ads on these bio videos and I'm like... Dude... I'm just tryna pass grade 10 calm down,0
"My bio teacher is well-known for not paying attention to any of her classes except chemistry, and then at the end of the year, giving out candy to all of her other classes and apologizing for being a shitty teacher. Of course, that does nothing to raise my grade in her class. But these videos do. Thanks so much y'all for helping me understand this flipping course.",0
"As a nutrition professor, thank you for this! Such a great resource for students!",1
"This song is essentially four different choruses, it's absolutely genius!",1
RIP Sarah. This is potentially the best pop song of all time. What a legacy.,1
I think this song is clever as hell the way it's written and produced. You can say what you like about Xenomania but personally I think they deserve credit where credits due. They make melodic pop music with a twist.,1
It's such a shame this song wasn't a hit in America.  This is pop perfection.,0
"The choreographer clearly gave them like two run-throughs of the dance, before running out of time and just saying ""Fuck it, this'll do"".",0
"RIP Sarah, you will be missed but this world is all the better for having had you in it. x",1
"I can't see myself getting tired of their songs, this song is one of their best",1
"In my humble opinion, this is THE best pop song of the 'noughties.' A three-minute masterpiece. Pop music is so dull at the moment -oh for a group this much fun again. As for those rather sad people who still think it's ok to describe the bright, interesting, talented Nicola Roberts as ""ugly, ginger""...easy to say it anonymously isn't it? Hmm. Oh - and forgot to say ""Downright gorgeous!'",1
"Without doubt the best song that has ever existed! A verse, another verse, a pre-chorus and a chorus. Brilliant",1
This guy. He's someone kids should look up to.,1
I feel like teachers like him could make anyone interested in anything... big respect!,1
"They could have this guy on 1,000 times and I’ll still eagerly watch every episode.",1
As someone who graduated with a Bio degree i truly wish he was a professor at my school. His natural excitement and passion for science is infectious and I feel like he would’ve made microbio so fun 😅💜,1
"5:28 He chose the one most wholesome answer you could hope to receive. Mans basically said, ""if I could bring back one species, it'd be the species that could save another that I love."" 😭😭😭😭 The man is too wholesome, my heart.",1
"Honestly, just bring him in every week at this point. I'd never get tired of him tbh",1
"This guy's pretty wholesome, good job on bringing him back",1
"i'm majoring in biology, so mad respect for you Dr. Thor Hanson!",1
"As a history major, he speaks the way that made me fall in love with history. He himself is fascinated by his own knowledge so it never becomes obvious or get boring",1
"I remembered having to learn about this when I was in high school Biology so I came back to see if it would come back to me at age 37. Nope, I ended up rocking back and forth in the corner of my office in the feeble position. Then I snapped out of it... I now embrace this truth - plants turn water, sunlight, and CO2 into food using magic",1
Watching this the day before my bio exam and realizing that I’m so gonna fail,0
""" you are committed to having a better, deeper understanding of our world; or more probably you'd like to do good on your test"" hahahaha this Hank guy is the best",1
"I failed Biology 3 times already, this is my 4th time taking the class. First time actually trying to seriously understand it. I’ve been watching your videos that relate to what we’re learning in class, I want to thank you for helping me earn a 92% on my first exam. I’m so grateful for you!",1
The fact that humans need stab proof vest to survive one of these guys tells you how deadly they can be,0
and There are still people that dare to say 'modern dinosaurs are boring' - just take a look at this absolute Unit!,0
"I'm from Brazil, and I heard ranchers telling stories such as about _that_ time their grandpa saw a harpy lifting a newborn calf duting his youth, or _that_ day a harpy snatched a hound in Goiás. Clearly exagerations, wild tales, but it shows the reverence, respect and even fear the Harpy commands on people. 

Also, the state police here where I'm from has _Harpia_ as a callsign their helicopters.",0
I wonder if the Harpy calls weren't only used to identify primates without a response but to actually wear down their awareness overtime by conditioning them to expect calls before seeing the eagle. We might see more of those mix-ups and mindgames if we observed them in areas where primates lived alongside eagles for more than a year.,0
"I've been a fan of Harpy's for years now, but this video blew my mind. The amount of intelligence gathered by the eagles during the BCI experiment is huge. Birds are truly in the same conversation as mammals in terms of ingenuity.",1
I cannot get over how gorgeous this bird is. It’s just beautiful. Incredible animal.,1
"You have the best science channel on the web, hands down. It easily rivals anything I’ve seen on television.  I am so damn impressed with every video I’ve seen from your team, and you deserve many millions of subscribers.  Thank you for a consistently incredible and enriching source of entertainment and education!",1
i train a small hawk and the strength hes capable of at his size is unreal i could only imagine what a Harpy could do 😵,1
The hour long complicated version with finger puppets is literally what I need.,1
Ah the photosynthesis and cellular respiration unit of Biology. Good luck to everyone else suffering :'),1
I wish he was my bio teacher 🤧💀😂 he makes everything so fun and easy !!! Also who has an exam tomorrow?,1

😀😀wow I got 29/30 ..thank you for the video ❤❤,1
25/30 I did pretty good 😊,1
It refreshed my knowledge. Thank you!!!!,1
Very interesting quizzes! :),1
These speculative biologies are always fun to watch. Always makes you wonder what really is out there.,1
"dumb idea: a C.A. video thats literally just exploring life on earth, describing the lifeforms with examples from fictional works in a role reversal way. treating the very real animals like their pieces of speculative work and vice versa. I.E. ""in the vast earth oceans live an apex predator unchanged for millions of years, the shark. though they look remarkably simular to the squidsharks of 4546B, but are more closely related to earth fish than squids"" as a terrible example",0
"I really like these speculative Alien lifeforms better than many we've seen on here - I think it's bc they feel aesthetically natural, like they are unlike most earth organisms but feel like they still obey the constraints of biophysics",1
"My son used to love drawing his own speculative alien worlds. From single cells to highly evolved, he never ceased to amaze me with how rich and diverse he populated them. I stumbled across awesome videos like this one and learned what he had done is a whole Thing. I share these with him and hope they spark his imagination as much as he does my own. Thank you for sharing these with us!

EDIT: Thank you for your patience if you still would like to see his old drawings. It's a busy time of year, but we'll get the track down and posted on my little channel soon!",1
"Another well-made video about speculative biology. Keep it up, sir.",1
This is one of the most fleshed out speculative biologies I've seen in this channel so far! The illustrations are high quality and the little interactions between these organisms in their alien ecosystem can be derived from the illustrations themselves and it's really interesting,1
Something I've noticed about alien spec bio things is that I don't often see structures analogous to fur or feathers on the critters. I wonder why?,0
"I love that this had very distinct biomes and body plans from each other. They all looked like they’d evolved together but really varied in color, size, and overall form. It also allowed for much more realistic looking (while still bloody  great and weird) scenes. Idk, I really liked this one, it was cool and kinda realistic in a weird way",1
"I would suggest checking out the anime ""Made in the Abyss"" for a potential episode. The fictional creatures in the work are downright awe inspiring as they are bizarre.",1
Thanks to cameraman live from million years ago for the documentary,1
"It's amazing that the skulls remain in the soil for millions of years for us to do such detailed scientific researches on. Without them, we never knew what they looked like or how they evolved. Fossils really are precious legacy of our ancestors.",1
"It's truly mind-blowing to know how far we've come and how we've become the dominant species on Earth in such a short amount of time. Considering how advanced we've become technologically, it seems almost impossible to think that we are also animals. Evolution is truly amazing!",1
"I'll never forget visiting the Natural History section of the Smithsonian Institute as a kid with my parents back in the 60's (I'm 69 now, BTW). They had an exhibit there that would blow your mind! It consisted of a wall depicting human evolution where they had probably a hundred or so skulls in rows against a dark backdrop, I assume so the images would stand out better. It led the viewer visually from human's earliest known ancestors with authentic fossil skulls from the most primitive (e.g. Australopithicus) all the way to modern man (Homo sapiens). It was quite impressive and left the viewer with no doubt about human evolution. There it was - in terms of a tangible fossil record, expertly organized - right before the viewers eyes.  😵‍💫",1
Wow.  I would love an hour long video with who ever made this.   That was so informative. And to the point. Thank you,1
"*SOME PEOPLE STILL ASK, ""WHY ARE THERE STILL APES (OR MONKEYS)?""*
It should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works. Apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes, and from that, due to their lack of education, they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans. That is not how evolution works, but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology. 

They might just as well have asked ""If dogs are descended from wolves, why are there still wolves?"" Or even ""If Americans came from Europe, why are there still Europeans?"" Just as dogs descended from a population of wolves, so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes. 

What we know is that the first apes evolved in Africa about 25 million years ago from a population of Old World Monkeys. Whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the TOPS of branches, apes evolved the ability to swing, arm over arm, from branch to branch. Evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment. For apes, that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it. At one time there were about 30 different  species of apes in those forests.

Had environmental conditions remained the same, we would still see forests covering the whole African continent. However, conditions did not stay the same; the climate became drier. As a result, forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands, the African savanna, with just a few scattered trees. The shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct.

Then, about 6 or 7 million years ago, one population of apes split, with some of them opting for life on that open savanna. All apes are capable of walking upright, they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time.  Recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them, walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking. Chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly.

That savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity. by about 4 mya, our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis, femur, knees and feet as modern humans. That gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel. They did however, retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened.

The apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change. They became the ancestors of today's chimps and bonobos. Those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes, and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them. It set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us.",0
"*SOME PEOPLE STILL ASK, ""WHY ARE THERE STILL APES (OR MONKEYS)?""*
It should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works. Apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes, and from that, due to their lack of education, they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans. That is not how evolution works, but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology.

They might just as well have asked ""If dogs are descended from wolves, why are there still wolves?"" Or even ""If Americans came from Europe, why are there still Europeans?"" Just as dogs descended from a population of wolves, so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes. 

What we know is that the first apes evolved in Africa about 25 million years ago from a population of Old World Monkeys. Whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the TOPS of branches, apes evolved the ability to swing, arm over arm, from branch to branch. Evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment. For apes, that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it. At one time there were about 30 different  species of apes in those forests.

Had environmental conditions remained the same, we would still see forests covering the whole African continent. However, conditions did not stay the same; the climate became drier. As a result, forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands, the African savanna, with just a few scattered trees. The shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct.

Then, about 6 or 7 million years ago, one population of apes split, with some of them opting for life on that open savanna. All apes are capable of walking upright, they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time.  Recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them, walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking. Chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly.

That savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity. by about 4 mya, our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis, femur, knees and feet as modern humans.

"I remember a high-school biology project in which we had to create a basic phylogeny graph for dragons, including drawings. It was very fun.",1
"I’m surprised there isn’t more dragons with names taken directly from mythical dragons. I could absolutely see Orochi, Gorynych, Lindwurms, Basilisks, Serrushes, Leviathan, Behemoth, Ziz, Python, Ladon, and even to an extent Typhon fitting in well to this family tree.",1
I’d love this as a video game. Create a Skyrim-esque world except where dragons aren’t mythical creatures but wild animals that could have adequate intelligence and small levels of society (like a smart dolphin). I think the approach would be cool bc it could be a mechanism for keeping humans in a medieval age since dragons would prey on cities like wolves on sheep.,1
"Since we did dragons, and horse paleontology is so rarely touched on, a unicorn or other myth creature could be another cool video",1
"A summary!

Video Two: Water
 H2O uses a covalent bond: each hydrogen shares an electron with oxygen. It is thus a polar molecule.
 All water molecules are attracted to each other due to this polarity – these are hydrogen bonds (between the positive and negative poles of different molecules)
 Hydrogen bonds in water results in high cohesion, and thus high surface tension.
 Cohesion is the attraction between two like things (e.g. two water molecules).
 Water has the highest cohesion of any non-metallic liquid.
 Adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things (e.g. water and glass).
 Capillary action is water defying gravity.
 Water is the greatest solvents (due to its polarity). 
 Hydrophilic molecules are polar – their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of water.
 Hydrophobic molecules cannot break the cohesive forces of water because they are non-polar.
 Solid water is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonds forming crystalline structures that space molecules apart more easily (when frozen).
 Water has a very high heat capacity – it is good at holding on to heat, thus oceans regulate climate and temperature of planets.",1
"I'm an accounting student, but I had a horrible chemistry teacher in high school and I'm taking this courses solely to have a better understanding of the world around me, and all I wanted to say was that they've been really helpful in making me understand (with a little extra reasearch) all the basics of chemistry! Thank you crashcourse!",1

"The best part about his style of teaching is the storyline and narrative visuals. He doesn’t just point out and explain, he makes you UNDERSTAND the whole biological process regardless how abstract the concept is. He paints a picture that you will remember, and that in itself, is a true talent. 💯",1
"I'm a dentist. Passed my boards years ago and am fully licensed but... man, I feel like a student all over again! This is a phenomenal presentation and a great review!

At totally random times, I sometimes shout 'Signal signal!' or hum random parts of the song while reading. This song is like the Genetic code itself, tightly packed with the entire summary of Evolutionary and developmental biology in a few minutes. I was starting out with Embryology when this song came out and this made me understand the genetic regulation part so well. Still waiting for some more amazing songs like this one. This is still my favorite though. It was my ringtone for a year.",1

Why recreate adversity? I'm definitely part of that sub-group against bonsai - it's crippling trees for just aesthetics and there's also some weird control issues to unpack around it. Just get some plants that are good for your local wildlife.,0
"People like to talk about ""torturing"" trees like they don't cut their grass every week.",0
I like the part that bonsai tree can grow big if allowed and can still make fruit/seed... so we could theoretically save endangered giant trees by making bonsais of them and have a hope that one day... there will be place where they can / their offspring can grow big again.,1
"So, a bonsai could theoretically become a normal, huge tree when planted elsewhere. But the question is, is a tree “happier” when it grows way bigger? Or is the tree happy when it’s small too? The obvious answer is no, the tree doesn’t care. Another answer would be “we have no way of knowing.” People like to assign emotions to things, but a lot of the time those emotions are just self-reflection. 

People assign the wrong emotions to animals too, even though we know animals can feel emotion, people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly. This happens all the time. 

So even when we find out trees can experience emotion (and some evidence already suggests this) we would probably still force our own perspective onto them, like we do now.

What we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do, with the conditions they are given. Are they “satisfied” being the tree that they are? I don’t think trees know this concept. I think people shouldn’t anthromorphise their idea of “succes and satisfaction” onto plants. In fact, people already project their ideas of success onto other people and animals who don’t need it. The trees definitely don’t need it either.",0

"Hank, great video as always.  One question:  you seemed to make a point of mentioning more than once that protists are unicellular, yet I was under the impression that protists (being the grey area they are as you mentioned) include all eukaryotes that are considered neither Animalia, Plantae, nor Fungi.  I was also under the impression that some of these Protista are indeed multicellular.

I have a question: what about viruses, do they also go into the same system? Or are they outside it?",1
Reading Bill Bryson’a a short history of nearly everything. Had to pull out my microbiology with taxonomy textbook. Thank you for your detailed presentations they are helping immensely with understanding this tip of the iceberg.,1
"Thank You Hank for acknowledging the constant change in our understanding of the world. It amazes me that even just 5 years after this video went up, the taxonomic system has changed so much that my college Biology of Organisms course has to teach an entirely new classification. Science has made a victory in the description of Supergroups and the integration of the meltingpot that was kingdom Protista into groups which better fit their traits and evolution (just as you hinted might be a good idea).",1
"Hi, i love crash course, been using it since 3rd grade and now in 7th and still using it.

I love how you explain everything with physical examples that makes it easier to understand. Keep the good work and please continue sharing the discoveries made about quantum mechanics.,1
This is truly going down a rabbit hole!!! I cant imagine the number of experiments that would have to be conducted to make such discoveries! And the amount of note taking and record ! This is brilliant! You have to be different to be able to carry on trying new way of doing things!,1
Amazing documentary. Things like this always blows my mind and enables me to think widely. And at the end of a topic when I learn something new and astonishing I cant help but smile bcs these are so amusing. Also huge respect to the scientists who are able to think and invent and see the world is such different perspectives. They inspire me a lot,1

Thank you for it and more, please.
Many thanks.",1
"I have watched this video for the 3rd time and it still fascinates me how there are still so much to learn about our world.
This is the first ever video that has introduced me to watching the intriguing explanations of quantum mechanics that now it has become my hobby during past time. Unfortunately, since I am on a different profession, this will just be a hobby.  I really wish I could dig deep into the rabbit's hole.
Kudos to Jim Al-Khalili and Spark for keeping it simple and mind blowing!",1
"I am so unbelievably happy, ans I haven't even watched part II. I mean, I know how it ends (maybe), I graduated in it, but THIS is how you should teach physics to students, THIS is entertaining, it's simple but extremely detailed and understandable at all levels, you won't get a class of teens looking at you like you're reciting the bible in latin backwards and then an average C score at the end . THIS is what Physics is, FUN. Endless thinking, endless possibilities, endless learning. Physics is the language of existence and we are just toddlers slowly navigating our ways through learning the ABCs of it, at any given point in time. This is life teaching us. There's nothing better than this. NOTHING. Yeh!",1
I'm late to this party but I wanted to let you know that your explanation of relativity and the graphic of the two trains has helped more of my physics students than any thing else I have come across. Simple. Elegant and accessible.  Thanks for the great videos.,1
I like how he explains the speed of light at the speed of light.,1
This is exceptionally explained. I was also a student of physics and can somewhat understand the complexities involved. I only wish that he should have taken half an hour instead of 15 minutes.  Hats off to you Sir and thanks.,1
"Really a video worth watching. Whenever I feel really negative about physics being attacked always by the odds in ""classrooms "" and ""exams"", this video heals me! Though I watch, I can't understand all of them,hope to understand in the near future!",1

"sending the electron through a magnetic field doesn't seem like asking ""are you spin up or down"", but rather ""will you orient yourself up or down when subjected to this field"" - and it seems logical that the left-right alignment would be random after that since then you're asking ""will you orient yourself left of right when subjected to this orthogonal field"".

"Four principles of technical communication: 
1. Start at the right point (From Known to Unknown) - ""show of hands"" - err on the side of caution
2. Don't go too far into the rabbit hole - explain 3 things that pique interest rather than a whole load of information
3. Clarity is better than Accuracy - iron out the finer details later
4. Explain why it is ""cool"" - enthusiasm is key 

Most importantly, convey ""It is not about whether you are good or bad at it, it is all about being interested in it!""",1

"It would definitely revolutionize how science is taught in schools anyway. Whether it is the all in one thing that ties them together, or not. It could be incredibly useful as a learning tool.",1
This is the best explanation of counterfactuals and Constructor Theory I've seen. I am sure a lot of good work went in to making it so simple to understand. Thank you.,1
"I very often find myself not wondering what David Deutsch is up to these days, and I would be entirely happy to hear about constructor theory after it has accomplished some accomplishments or gathered some buy-in within the discipline, instead of (as currently seems to be the case) before.",1
"Hope this will make your life easier..

"People who take time out of their lives to make this much content over challenging subjects are the greatest types of people on the planet. Idk who runs this, but I cannot express how thankful I am for them. To get this type of assistance from a real person, I'd be paying hundreds and hundreds of dollars to learn the same thing. I actually watch these videos on Spring break for the joy of simply learning. Thank you.",1
"Let's help this guy, by not skipping on the ads and subscribe to his channel.. 
I'm preparing for my board exams in electro engineering and this helps me really alot!! Thank You Man☺",1
"I can't begin to describe how frustrated and hopelessly lost I felt trying to learn physics the first time around. If it wasn't for your videos and help, I don't think I could stay within my major. Your work is absolutely invaluable, and your videos are actually life changing for me. I can't afford tutors, but these videos give me a real fighting chance to achieve all of my educational goals. Thank you so so so so much! You are an absolute gem, and I hope you know how much we all appreciate you  <3",1
"My professor uses your videos to ""teach"" us during online class. It has come to the point that we recognize you as our professor more.

Thanks for your vids!",1
I just wanted to say that your physics playlist helped me immensely to get a 5 on the AP Physics C Mechanics exam. Your videos are a godsend and I extremely appreciate all the work you put into them. I'll definitely be revisiting this channel during college!,1
"is it weird that it's one of the goals of my life to meet this person , just so much that he helped me a lot during a lot of hard times. Words aren't enough to express how grateful i am and blessed are we to have someone like this amazing person teach his knowledge for free and continues to do so. I salute you sir thank you for helping me out through times!",1
"This kind of youtube channel deserves an award for the effort and time the creator has put in to help students. Great summary and review. I salute you sir.

Btw I'll be taking soon may NMAT exam for medicine. Goodluck to mee😅",1
a mistake at 1:33:53 it was meant to be 20m on the incline instead of 10m but overall i get the way it work and good explations. thanks alot!,1
"Bless your soul. Man, you are a time saver, rather than doing a time consuming note reading, I just listen to you and it's already summarized!",1

"I have a pretty big physics problem that has perplexed me my whole life.

The closest supermarket from where I live is 500 meters (roughly) and it takes me 12 minutes to walk there and back at a walking speed of 5 kph (3 mph). The problem is it has taken my father 18 years to make this trip and I want to know how this strange phenomenon has occurred.",0
"When I was a kid, I discovered that you could stand up a straw in a glass of soda pop and miraculously, soda would come out of the top of the straw slowly like a tiny fountain. Back in those says, the straws were all paper. You have shown me the answer to this phenomena and I thank you.",1
The slow-mo audio of the ring falling down the chain has to be one of the most satisfying sounds I've heard,1
"I've learned the ""flicking the bottle/can"" trick a while ago like 10-15+ years ago and only learned today why that works. Thanks a lot.",1
I think it would be cool to see how the results of the ice experiment varies when you use a fresh water ice cube in the fresh water glass and a salt water ice cube in the salt water glass. You can also test using salt water cubes in both glasses and compare all the combinations. Very nice video.,1
"I thoroughly enjoyed this science talk and learnt quite a lot then I would in class. Thank you!
Now onto your next video as I down my non-equilibrium beverage 🥤",1
"Ohhhhh my God! I wait for these episodes like most people wait for the next Tom Cruise movie! Thank God for Brian Greene, for showing us the beauty of Physics!!",1
"So great to see Leonard Susskind on air! This is how physics should be presented - no egos, no showboating, just great minds discussing complex concepts that us mere mortals can begin to understand.",1
"Seriously thank you. I particularly am sad that I never pursuid physics in my higher education as these are the subjects that bring colour to my life. I think it might not be praised enough that we still get to learn about these amazing ideas, even more so from the most incredible field experts, for free from anywhere in the world. I would like to take these few minutes to show my gratitude towards these actions and to professor Brian Greene! Thank you all for your contributions looking for answers (or more questions) and communicating us the findings, forever grateful.",1
I loved when you take a glance at Mark listening to Leonard speak because he just has the biggest smile on his face. You can tell how much respect everyone has for each other and their individual interpretations. This was a phenomenal listen and I can’t wait for more.,1
"Yet another marvelous production from the World Science Festival. I wait for every new episode as if sitting at the edge of my seat as these brilliant, hardworking individuals reveal more details about the saga we call “life”. Thank you so much, Brian Greene, for taking the time to help connect us with all of this valuable insight.",1
"Thank you Brian and everyone behind the scenes who make WSF, you are doing a great service!",1
Please keep these amazing episodes coming. Brian Greene is so good at bringing everything and everyone together to present these amazing theories to all. Compelling with stellar production. More please.,1
Brian is just incredible- I loved physics growing up and wanted to be a quantum physicist but also loved medicine and became a doctor but my heart feels alive when I read any papers on quantum physics and attend such lectures - may be one day I will become physicist for now I learn through such amazing videos and papers thanks so so much,1
I love you and your books Mr. Kaku🥺 I'm almost clueless when it comes to physics but your books are so well written that I could understand the concept to some extent. I am easily hooked on reading every line in your books because they all are intriguing. Thank you and wish you everything ❤️,1
"Michio is such a gem for the world.  Pushing our minds is always a good thing! I don't understand most of his ideas, but I try, it he is so inspirational!",1
It only took one year of physics at uni to demonstrate to me that I would be better off studying biological sciences 😊.  The mind of a high level physicist is an awesome and occasionally strange thing to behold when it is on display.   I have great respect for any scientist who is also an educator!,1
"Thank you for finally explaining “string theory” in words a non-physics person as myself could understand.  Now maybe you could explain why it isn’t called vibration theory.  I believe, with that,  I would have been more accepting of what you said today years ago.",1
"I remember watching Michio Kaku's shows on discovery science as a kid, he made me interested in science and I probably learned English from those shows, and if I traveled back in time to close the TV then, it's likely I wouldn't go back to being an engineer. I'm a little sad to see him getting older 10 years later, but I'm glad that he is as passionate about string theory as ever. It's funny how some people can change your life without them ever knowing.",1
"I have a theory that I would like to get out... If this is the leading theory we are to accept... You inspired me when I was a young child, Michio Kaku. I read your book Hyperspace when I was about 12 and it changed my life. I have since been building upon many theories of many great minds such as yourself... And I think I have discovered something that I feel I should go public with as soon as possible. I've never written a book before... It is intimidating... And one day, I hope to have your blessing. Because without you, I may have never come to these ideas... And, even within my theory, there is a place for string theory, as it embodies such a theory in a way. I hope to meet you one day. Thank you for everything. :)",1
As history goes all that was once a theory/Hypothesis/dream   has been turning out to be possible in more than one occasion  kudos to you Professor  Kaku,1
"Dr. Kaku. Nice to see you still educating us on the exciting elements of life in the Universe. You and I met in December of 1999, when I was a producer at Fox News Channel working on our Y2K special. The program, focusing on what the future held for humankind, was a big success, and in my opinion you were the star.",1

This dude makes it look easy!  Respect!,1
He repeats his stories alot. and tbh i think that's what made him such a good explainer. He hones the same explanation until he masters it and finally blesses us young minds.,1
"I've been following Mr. Kaku for nearly 15 years now, and he is still till this very day the best professor i have ever seen anywhere. He influenced more young brains than people give him credit for, people who will unlock the secrets of Dark Matter and so on, will be people who were influenced by this man at some point in their life, and that's amazing, this man is perfect.

Thank you Sir, Professor Michio Kaku.",1
He makes everything seem so evident and easy. I'm glad to be born in a period where this man exists ❤️,1
This was the most comprehensible and engaging physics lesson I’ve ever witnessed. The realization that the Big Bang was the fissioning of universes…wow. And I actually understood the description of worm holes. Incredible knowledge and presentation!,1
"I have been a fan of Dr. Kaku for decades. His knack for breaking down complex subjects into easily understandable terms, combined with a refreshing sense of humor, makes Dr. Kaku a natural teacher and a pleasure to listen to.",1
"I would like to say, thank you to all of the historical pioneers that have discovered the building blocks of both,science and mathematics. Each of you are brilliant shining “stars”.",1
This guy never fails to make me feel like I'm learning something while also teaching absolutely nothing new and simply conceptualizing every sentence.,1
"Michio Kaku : 
maybe the most captivating educator I have ever listened to:
He is one, of very few, who make it a sheer joy to learn how to understand things.",1
Should I Upload Daily? ALSO Make Sure To LIKE The Video And Subscribe! 😉👍❤️,1
He’s “rich” but can’t afford better quality lol 😂,0
I love how he said his controller cost 10k but you can get it at games stop for 19 bucks 😂😂😂,1
This acting is top quality and I started laughing when he says this game play is about to crazy,1
I love how he sounds like a 5 year old when he says I got him,1

"Neutrinos are what got me into physics when I was 18 years old, and the more I learn about them the more fascinating they become!",1
"""Neutrino oscillations might sound somewhat mysterious but really it's just linear algebra, complex numbers, unitary matrices, eigenvectors and so on""  she always makes me smile 😃",1
A thing I found amazing is that something like  10% of the energy from a nuclear reactor is carried away by the neutrinos it radiates.,1
Thank you Sabine! I love when you go into this level of detail or more.,1
"Ahhh, problems with the Standard Model, who'd have guessed. I had some wonderful arguments with 'particle' physicists while living near CERN a few years back... but I've had problems with this particular theory since the Copenhagen Interpretation of the 1920s.",0
"Thank you Sabine,  so we’ll thought out and executed.  My mind expands every time I hear you explain. 👍🏻",1
"I really enjoy many of Sabine's videos. Very informative; it's great to have critical thinkers for these complex issues. She can be a great ""debunker"" as well. She seems very objective and unafraid to step on anyone's ""toes"".",1

Ok I normally find it funny when someone asks what a gold digger is even when he’s 8 but this time I just didn’t laugh he sounds like a good kid man,1
U r a gift from god this is the first video I watched on your channel and I want to let you know that I wish you a prosperous life filled with joy and happiness with fun times God bless you physics's,1
I feel so bad for that kid he’s cute and I and I hope he keeps up the good work and lives a happy long life I hope you has a good life,1
Yo you helping this kid is the best thing on YouTube,1
"This is the kind of content that has a real impact on the current revolution in the online education. Clear, eloquent, well animated - a real gem for curious minds. Thank you for doing this.",1
When YouTube search gives you exactly what you were looking for. It’s new. It’s long. It’s well explained. Finally some good YouTube,1
"As a Physics student, I have to say that this is an amazing introduction to the standard model. This video deserves to be played at schools as part of their curriculum! It explains all of the important aspects in a simple way that upcoming students can easily understand. Thank you for your contributions to science communication.",1
Less than halfway through the video and it's already one of the best-explained quantum physics videos I've ever seen.,1
I've been rewatching this for a while now😂. It's actually pretty interesting but I'm finding it hard to understand the leptons( especially the lepton numbers) symmetries and the neutrinos. But except all that I understood the rest. You really explained very well and you made it very comprehensive and detailed. Thanks very much😊😊❤️.,1
The best explanation I have ever seen about the standard model. Congratulations!,1
Can you do a map of all simple groups in abstract algebra? That would be awesome,1
I wish I had seen this years ago!  Trying to visualize particle physics in my head has always been my stumbling block and this video just made it a whole lot easier.,1
I can't believe how perfectly timed this is with my current physics class,1
"I've been doing thermodynamics in some way, shape or form for three years now and this has been by far the best presentation for these concepts that I've come across. Thanks Dr. Shini. Lecturers could literally spend two days explaining what she did in ten minutes in class. You guys are awesome.",1
I love everything about this video. I wish my expensive classes were as entertaining and as cleverly put together.,1
Loving the series. Thank you for all your hard work!,1
"This is so helpful! We've been doing thermodynamics as uni but I tend to sit in letcures with my eyes glazed over because I didn't fully understand the basics when we first learned them, so anything more complicated is too confusing.....",1
this is honestly sooo helpful keep up the good work,1
Thank you for this video! I am taking thermodynamics 2 right now and this is honestly a great review of all the basic thermo ideas!,1
"Thx for this. .) I have exam next week, this is lifesaving. :) But exam is just ""little"" more complex but it whould start me up realy good. :) Love this channel.",1
"Physics is so interesting when you actually get to know and understand it, I really want to sue all my school teachers for not doing their jobs correctly and for only scraping the surface when it comes to Physics, it really is just so frustrating when you are so interesting in something that you can't even understand properly",0
"Very cool stuff. At first I thought, ""They need to explain these effects verbally."" Then I saw the written notes. You have pointed out some very good examples of how Physics can be weird, and provided links and explanations for effects.  Very Good job!",1
"-Music that isn't obnoxious
-No Numbers
-No Annoying narrator
-Actually pretty cool tricks
-Not clickbait


A+, my guy(s). Love it.",1
I love these experiments! So usable and functional for people in quarantine at home! Love it ❤️,1
"I really enjoyed this video! I love how it ""teach"" everything in a  so simple and easy way!!! and best of all, it's short and eye-catching",1
"This is absolutely amazing! thank you for explaining everything, no numbers, no annoying narrators, and just actually being legit good people",1
Thumbs up for a great video of really cool physics demonstrations. An extra thumbs up for excellent explanations in the description. Well done!,1
"Wow, la verdad te felicito, muy buenos trucos :)
Aprecio también el hecho que hayas puesto subtitulos, ¡Gracias!",1
Amazing!! Love these videos and can't wait until my kids are a bit older so I can show them the beautiful world of science.,1
"After all the years I have been interested in physics, I love finding out new things about how the discoveries were  made, and the people involved.",1
"Amazing lecture Suzie and excellent way of taking a stand on the nature of science and how we have used it and how we should use it. You could have even talked more about the scientist+civilians ""sacrificing"" or loosing their lives after doing experiences with new inventions etc. Many lives were lost due the lack of safety issues back in the days or just due to not knowing all the side effects etc. Excellent job Suzie. I am very amazed by your work and by your wisdom.",1
"What a fantastic journey through the discovery of physics..... Fascinating! Well done Suzie for making a difficult subject to understand so accessible. Frankly, I didn't think that this would be an easy watch, but it was well explained and your excitement for science is quite infectious. I'm looking forward to reading your book. Excelsior!!!!!!!",1
Outstanding lecture. Interesting and fun. Thank you.,1
"Truly a remarkable presentation!! I read probably my most highly inspirational book by my newfound role model, Fundamentals: The Ten Keys to Reality by Frank Wilczek who he references experiments as well as other interesting findings in this presentation. There’s also the book, QED The Strange Theory of Light and Matter by Richard P. Feynman which this video helps me visualize the x-rays excitements.

These all ultimately lead me to a sense of motivation and question as to what’s left to discover?

Well I position myself towards LIGO Virgo KAGRA into understanding gravity and gravitational waves.

Of course education follows, but for now I am currently reading a booklet called Relativity the 100th anniversary; as instructed I have not proceeded further until I am fully convinced on the requirement needed in chapter 8.

For the vitality of humankind.",1
An excellent subject and lecture! Thank you!,1
Really inspiring talk. Thank you so much,1
Very well presented and informative. Well done Suzie and I will buy her book.,1
what a great way of explaining with a love for the subject .....thank you,1
"Almost like they're making their own ""fields"" and then creating particles by putting different levels of energy into those ""fields."" Amazing.",1
"I saw a video by Veritasium where he showed the Moiré lattice pattern, he held two transparent sheets of a honeycomb-ish pattern overlapping, and I remember seeing the different shapes and structures emerging, being completely fascinated! I got way too excited about it and felt silly. I'm a 30 year old woman, and I wanted to have these sheets myself to explore these patterns, they're beautiful. I knew there was something to it, and this video makes me very, very happy! Can't wait to see more from this research and channel, I'm a new subscriber.",1
"I'd love to see a more in-depth video about the mechanics of how the stacked sheets create virtual atoms!

What are the limitations? Are there any conceivable functional/commercial uses (beyond research).

What an exciting development in physics research! I'm surprised this is the first I'm hearing of this technique/technology.",1
"So many developments like this seem hypey. But this one, dropping to 2D is such a beautiful simplification, lends itself to sane-time computer simulation. The moiré bit, again, beautiful. Reminds me a lot of X-ray crystallography, maybe similar potential for discovering how stuff works.",1
This channel is so high quality and criminally under-watched. Another A+ video,1
Wow. This feels like game changing research. New technology here we come. Material sciences are fascinating.,1
Whoa. I love this type of minimalist approach to problems in general. It's so elegant here. Very inspiring!,1
"Humans are smart, but I think we are really learning insight into our abilities when we try to understand what we perceive. Is the moon there when we don't look at it, read about object permanence in psychology for instance. There are many other interesting correlations like this which may shed some light on observation. We are reaching the limit of being able to discern what is novel with what could be attributed to another already agreed understanding even if the correlation is not obvious. Even our inherent bias may get in the way, and like any puzzle, such as a sadoku, we may eventually learn that the complex mathematics could be on the wrong track and have to be scrapped only to have to start basically from some previous branch no matter how far back, and finally, it seems we are fast running out of feasible experiments to confirm or deny the predictions made by quantum mechanics.",1
"Absolutely fascinating. 
Thank you, thank you",1
I have for many years studied this phenomenon and i am still awestruck,1
It tells us that we are looking at the universe through the wrong end of the telescope.,0
"I thought the content and editing of this docu was really very good. Let down, however, once again, by an agonising and overly intrusive soundtrack of bings, bongs, muzak and mood noise that was so distracting it was actually fighting the content for my attention. Please, please dispense with this nonsense. Or offer a noise pollution free variant. It is such a problem in shows such as this. Horizon in the UK is especially bad.",0
🗣️MY MIND JUST EXPANDED WITH THE UNIVERSE STRAIGHT UP! 💯 😎,1
"As if the designers of the universe overlooked the possibility that a species would evolve enough to work out some of it. No wonder it makes no sense at a quantum level. When they realise what we're up to, we'll know they know. Imagine that was actually true :D",0

I would love the vbucks and the reason I think I deserve it is I've been subed since 400k and I love your videos,1
Man your like the best you make kids so happy when there sad,1
Love your videos and I hope that kid has the best life,1
"What's up, been a long time subscriber love the content keep up the good content",1
"3:04 I can tell by the multiple times he says he’s getting high ground and how Physics doesn’t care, the he’s one of those obsessive jerks that keeps bullying even though no one really cares. Cleary the high ground doesn’t matter because every time he absolutely bodied him",0
His videos are always funny and cool and kind,1
I deserve the vbucks because I’ve watched your channel for a 2 years and I would love to gift several of your subscribers skins,1
"Life, man. What is it even?",0
"Meanwhile this evening I did a (bad) impression of Prof Cox on stage to a few hundred people. And even though it was so dodgy, everyone knew who it was as he’s such a legend. Nice to hear him talk about Sagan, as many see him as a modern version",1
"""We are a way for the Universe to know itself."" - Carl Sagan, of course. The scientist with the heart of a poet. 
Excellent discussion with a favorite physicist, Professor Brian Cox. I could listen to him all day. Thank you, Be Smart, and PBS, for the thought-provoking video. Subscribed.",1
"You sir, are a superlative teacher! And so is Professor Cox.  This has been one of the most fascinating interviews and YouTube presentations that I have seen. But then, I’m an old man, an old medical doctor of a man, who has had the pleasure of experiencing many good and great teachers in his lifetime. And learning new things, for me, remains one of my greatest pleasures. And this border/ conjunction between the life sciences and the physical sciences is one of my greatest fascinations.  I am so very glad that I found your channel and subscribed to it.",1
"Brian Cox as always, doesn’t disappoint… He’s very deep and thoughtful in a very accessible way…",1
"I absolutely love Professor Brian Cox, after watching his TedTalk about a year ago I watched as many videos of him as I could and he has incredibly increased my interest in physics and astronomy! Thank you for the great video!",1
This channel is a key example of why publicly funded media is still so important in the digital era. The right people given the right resources can do amazing things and grow to provide so much more value to society than what was invested. Keep up the amazing work!,1
"Very thought provoking video.  I've always found Brian Cox's viewpoints VERY Interesting.  He sees the same things as other scientists, but he helps us think about it just a little differently than many, which can help us think differently ourselves. Fascinating!",1
"One of the most interesting, informative and thought-provoking discussions   I have ever seen. Thanks guys.😄",1
Something funny I just noticed. Aside from looking sort of alike both Brian Cox and Shigeru Miyamoto seem to almost be incapable of speaking without smiling. Being experts in completely different fields both just seem so curious and enjoying what they do. What a joy to listen to these guys and just have them around.,1
Welp there are literally no excuses at this point. You can literally teach yourself anything,1
"Its truly a great time to be alive, to be able to have resources like this be so freely available for anyone to use.",1
"This is remarkably clearly communicated. Almost unique. Every single wording, every sentence, is chosen with a purpose. The examples are very descriptive. Needless to say, the topic is a bit complex. It is adressed, subject to an almost perfect understanding of exactly when the apprentice finds some topic extra difficult. Imagine having a teacher like this when being in formative years. Sometimes in life, you happen to encounter people with an above-human talent to communicate complex matters in an accessible way. Simple enough but not to simple. It is important to recognize this and to cherish those rare moments.",1
What a great professor! Thanks for giving us the opportunity to learn from you!,1
Wow. Many a thanks. Never thought will be able to see course of such quality in Youtube,1
"This is the first lecture where I actually ended up feeling like I finally got general relativity, thank you!",1
"Thanks for the video! I've always been interested in physics, but chose to go into chemistry for undergrad. It's awesome to have great explanations and videos so easily accessible.",1
"Dear Professor, thank you for your generosity. I’m actually listening to your lecture at work as music. It brings me back to my university days. Lots of things you teach much better too",1
Masterpiece ❤️Thanks a lot sir✨it's a complete video course in it's own,1
When your physics teacher doesn't teach you physics so you rely on the internet,0
"she makes 10000 times more sense than my professor, who didnt explain anything and just started writing equations on the board.",1
She has a lot of potential to become a rapper,1
These videos are saving physics students lives' every single day,1
Does the sound dim at random points for anyone else? It's like someone muffled the mic arbitrarily.,0
This is a better explanation than I've heard in any college physics/engineering course. Thanks.,1
Electronic engineer here…You just explained static electricity better than all my teachers in university. The topic can be very confusing for beginners. This course gets better every time!,1
"This would be a great introduction for a Crash Course Electronics series. I really think you guys do a great job explaining complicated things, simply.",1
Kudos to this man for going out of his way to present something that his students will remember for the rest of their lives.,1
I had a physics teacher similar to this my junior year. He always presented everything we were learning in a tangible way with real application. Looking back it was my favorite course.,1
"I remember watching this exactly 10 years ago and being amazed by it, I tried the experiment in an empty classroom. 10 years later physics still fascinates me!",1
I can learn more from this dude than my actually physics teacher 😂😂😂,1
"I miss his lectures so much!!! They were posted here on YouTube for a while. I’m not sure if they are anymore, but he is one of the reasons I love physics!",1
"Even knowing the results, my heart was still beating fast when he released the ball",1
"We want more than this honorable teacher, the theory and the practice in the mean time, learning for the students will be a real pleasure, thank you Sir.",1
i never took a interest in physics but this dude made me understand the basics of converting gravitational potential to kinetic enegry. huge respect,1
"For once, a teacher got my undivided attention on a subject that bored me in high school and college. I would have loved to have you as my science teacher. You kept my interest. Thank you very much.",1
"Very cool. My grandfather, who died at 95 right before the pandemic, used to collect physics toys and loved to demonstrate and explain how they work. Because of him I have a good understanding of buoyancy, surface tension, states of matter, electrical conductance, and many other concepts. We need people like you to teach this stuff to the next generation. Keep up the good work.",1
Those vortex marbles are pieces of art! 😍,1
"I had multiple ""oil drop timers"" as a kid, love those things",1
"I had several oil drop timer as a kid and I didn't remember for 25 years until this video, very cool :) They were so fascinating, and I could watch them for hours.",1
The Perpetual Motion Simulator is similar to the Space Wheel that used to sell for about ten dollars. Used ones on Amazon are now going for ten times that...but they're still cool.,1
This perpetual motion simulator looks quite cool. I also remember having one of these Oil drop timers many many years ago.,1
Another knowledge to shared thanks a lot 😉,1
I learnt about this in my physics book on perpetual motion  a long time back . Very fascinating to watch .,1
The perpetual motion simulator is really something I could watch ALL day.,1

"I think it's really a testament to your explanation skills that the Schrodinger equation seems like it's the obvious solution once you've seen it. It was, of course, not obvious, even to Schrodinger himself. The time and effort you must put into these videos is astounding, and I thoroughly enjoy watching them. Great work!",1
"In all of my university courses, textbooks, websites, and videos I've indulged to learn intro QM, this is easily the best overview with the clearest and most well-put explanations and motivations. Thank you.",1
"I love how you start building up from the historical background, something we don’t see often. I hope you will upload more often❤️",1
"It always amazed me, that when I was in school everything about quantum mechanics was a synonym of something very difficult and counterintuitive, thanks to the pop culture and popular science articles/videos on youtube. After studying in university it turned out to be much easier, espesially considering that classcial mechanics is not that simple either. If i saw this video 5 years ago I would have understood that fact earlier. Thank you for this clear and neat explonation.",1
"Outstanding work.  I somehow managed to understand all of it, whilst understanding none of it at each stage.  Coming from a non-physics background, and with only a limited understanding of calculus, to be able to carry a viewer with my limited ability along is testament to your superb communication.  Thank you.",1
Having taken a physics degree many decades ago may I congratulate you on such an excellent presentation.,1
"Just the perfect amount of details. The depth and breadth of these videos are fantastic, thank you for putting all this effort into them!",1
I hope you know this video came at the perfect time for me. Ive been teaching myself quantum chemistry from a physical chemistry textbook recently and i was using your channel to understand blackbody radiation haha. Glad to see a new video from you man! You always put in an insane amount of time into these,1
"I am doing my doctorate in Engineering, and studying theoretical physics is my all time favourite hobby. I am going to derive all these myself now. Many thanks for creating this wonderful presentation.",1
Beautifully explained! What a great refresher of QM with valuable illustrations,1
let me remind people who are scared....... splitting an atom makes it blow up...... smacking two particles together doesnt make explosions it makes fusions......,0

"Ooops, pushed again into another alternate dimension?! I wonder what this one will be like?",0
"We need more people like Penrose! He is really thinking outside the box. He doesn't put assumptions on all the things he learned, like many smart people still do. We need more people like him, who is curious and ask the right questions. He truly knows where the black spots are in our knowledge. He points them out clearly. We are watching a genious of our time. 200 years from now he will be known because he was one of the few who understood how little we know and where we should look",1
"Wow! I am so glad I discovered Dr. Penrose today. I wanted to refrain from any comments, but I have to say that the Interviewer asked better questions than Dr. Peterson and he seemed to understand what Prof. Penrose was meaning, whilst Dr. Peterson's brain seemed to short-circuited a few times. My view is that Dr. Peterson came in with an upfront agenda, not to learn but to convince. Kudos to Prof Penrose for schooling Dr. Peterson. Okay, I said enough.",1
"Sir Roger will probably be with us for another decade, he seems incredibly lucid and physically well, my grandfather is 96 and still going strong, and he looked very much like Sir Roger does here when he was 90.",1
"Despite being a brilliant mathematician, Nobel laureate physicist, worldly acclaimed academic,  I love how willing Sir Roger is to say ""I don't know""",1
Aren't we all so fortunate to be able to listen in and watch a conversation like this?,1
Damn this man is sharp for his age. My granddad (bless his soul) only got to live to the age of 79 and in his last 3 years he deteriorated to such a degree that he couldn't function at all. It was sad to witness. Sir Penrose is 90 now (almost 91) and he talks about stuff in a very clear way which most adults aren't able to do. Amazing.,0
"Dr. Peterson, there is another physicist (turned philosopher) who wrote a lot about the nature of the mind and of consciousness, basing himself in his understanding of physics. His name was David Bohm. He is now deceased, but he wrote a book called ""Wholeness and the Implicate Order"" in which he discusses several things which might be relevant to this conversation, and which I found very enlightening. I recommend it to you. And while you're at it, you might as well also look into his interpretation of quantum mechanics, called Bohmian mechanics, since you showed interest in quantum theory. His interpretation gets rid of the inconsistency/incompleteness from which the standard interpretation suffers in an elegant and easy to understand way, and in a way which takes all of the apparent ""magic"" out of the theory.

I was fascinated to see that Roger Penrose uses Godel incompleteness to support his views on the nature of consciousness, since I came to the same conclusions on my own years ago based on the same mathematics. So cool to hear my ideas coming from the mouth of such a brilliant man!",1

We need people who can break complex information down and also explain things like you do. Thank you so much for doing what you right and God bless",1
I feel like everythings gonna be ok when I watch your videos. Thanks !,1
YOU ARE A LIFE SAVER! I got stuck with a pretty bad teacher and literally would've failed my exam if it wasn't for you!!!!!,0
I've been spending two weeks listening to my professor but I haven't learned a thing until I watched your 3-hour video. You have no idea how grateful I am to you.,1

"All of these are awesome, I  think I want to master the discipline of physics. It is one of the greatest phenomena in nature.",1
"Great video, thank you!!  
On my channel are a series of ion propelled aircrafts that are patented specifically for lifting their power supplies against Earth's gravity.  They can fly with no moving mechanical parts.  They create a downdraft with solid state electronics that is sufficient to propel them upwards.  They don't defy physics though, rather they rely on well-known physics.  It used to be that ion propulsion could not lift its power supply from the ground. There are more than 40 public videos of the craft.",1
"Amazing video thank you! Yes, atomic motion is perpetual. Mass changing its position in space = motion. Perpetual? Well for most of us billions of years is long enough. So, examples of perpetual motions (does not factor in wear and tear of the device); solar panels, water mills, wind mills, geo thermal (Iceland), John Bedini generator which uses a drive battery that looses only a few milliamps while the charging battery gains hundreds of millivolts (I personally recharged hundreds of batteries, with carefully measured results)... The physics here at play is to not be stuck to one view, one device and what it does by itself. Yes that's being confined to thermodynamics. However, look outside the box for energy source (solar panels obtain their energy not from photovoltaic panels, but from the sun). Thermodynamics is true in CLOSED or ISOLATED systems. Nitinol is also overunity (which perpetual motion is a part of) using cold and hot water to activate it cyclically.  The most abundant phase of matter in the universe is plasma (an electrically charged - ionized gas). Well, a lot of energy could be pulled out of these stellar gas, and they will be energized until the end of time by stars. Are we introverted into a small device set in motion, or are we scientifically, logically looking at the big picture? As long as we stay stuck in a boxed-in frame of reference, we don't progress. Every advances made was possible by women and men who dared looking at things holistically, from all points of view. Cheers!",1
starlite is pretty incredible stuff........it can even be used as heat sheild coating on spacecraft (like the tiles on the american's space shuttle).,1

"Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I am taking physics RN at university and you teach me much more than my professors actually do. The way you break things down is so helpful and easy to follow.",1
I- Thank you. Teaching me more in 30 mins that my teacher can in 30 days😭,1
"He did it again. The man who saves academic careers. Thanks man, really",1
You are amazing! Thank you so so so much!!!! These videos are extremely helpful. You know exactly how to break everything down and make it simple then build on it. Thank you thank you thank you!,1
You are the best professor I have this semester,1
Your videos will teach learners the day before their test for years to come. Thank you.,1
Love Susskind and his no nonsense outlook on the world 🌎,1
"Quantum entaglement is a phenomenon that must be researched much more, it is simply amazing.",1
On the Stanford channel I obsessively watched all of Susskind's lectures.,1
The audio is pulled from a talk given by Susskind at UC Berkeley. Search for it on YouTube and you’ll find it. Not sure why this channel doesn’t cite that talk in the description. They’re just repackaging sound bites with impressive graphics.,0
"you know when someone is worth little if people talk about what he researches, not what he accomplished or what his research accomplished

everyone is constantly researching life, just by living it
but we dont give a shit, unless you manage something useful. 
and so is with this guy. just very unremarkable.",0
"I love how all the old theories that haven’t quite been proved to a few have been jumbled together into new science, we are as a species so intelligent, through trial error and years and years of mechanics and maths has brought us so close to answering so many deep questions about the universe, when we as a species unlock all its secrets we will be the most dominant force in the universe",1
This video was so good I didn’t even realize it was 8 years old,1
I think we've just found the most intense hype man for trees,1

one reason i like you so much is that your so positive and you should,1
"Math isnt my favorite subject, but this looks so interesting. I think that I can get good at this kind of math if I study and practice alot. I really want to learn this stuff.",1
"For all highschoolers and University students having midlife crisis. Computer science is fun since you get to build stuff that doesn't yet exist or build something that you use and make it a lot better. Computer science is the study of computers involving complex algorithms and you'll be looking for stuff on the internet and stackoverflow alot. you don't have to memorize everything like a computer but you have to know how to make a computer memorize and process the information and perform the activities that you want it to.

The way you described discrete maths made me realize i dont even hate math i just have to study to get better,1
Your videos are so solid and legitimately helpful. You have an understanding of the topics and give in depth content/examples. Thanks my man. Nuggets of YouTube.,1
Wow. I swear this is one of the best youtube channels I've ever come across. You're exceptionally knowledgeable about all these fields. Thank you so much.,1
"Good video. Im in the least popular branch in CS, cs theory research. I'm glad you mentioned induction, if one dives into program verification, you'll see that induction is essential to doing any kind of proof because induction corresponds to recursion in programming. Induction on the natural numbers may not be interesting, but think about induction on your data types and proving properties about them. In fact, induction does not only apply to natural numbers, but any inductively defined set.",1
"Damn, this got me more excited for computer science. The discrete maths seems very interesting and eager to learn about it.",1
Great video!!! I’m back in school taking classes for my masters of computer science. My bachelors was in economics. I'm trying to decide on if I should do a concentration in big data management or cybersecurity. What do you think is the better choice? Income and job market differences between these two?,1
Thank you very much! I've just finished my first semester at c.s and indeed we did all of those! This is great for showing what will be in the first semester.,1
"As someone who just graduated with a CS degree, I can confidently say that you successfully condensed 4 years of my life into 13 minutes. Well done!",1
"It's mind-blowing how you're able to explain so much in a single video, while being completely accurate, easy to understand and also funny. I think you're one of the best content creators on Youtube and this might be one of the best tech videos I've ever seen. Go Fireship!!",1
"thanks, legendary content. really appreciate the work you put into it",1
Im wrapping up my second semester as a CSE major and I was pleasantly surprised to see that I've already learned a huge chunk of these concepts. I really love this field so far and I can't wait to learn more!,1
No one can deny that the most important CS concept in this video is 101st computer science concept. You just simply cannot let grandma down,1
"That was astonishingly well written, edited and generally put together. Thank you for the work you put in, Jeff. That was a trip.",1
My entire CS degree just flashed in those 13 minutes. Amazing work!,1
"I'm about 2 years into teaching myself programming alongside my full time job and this is one of the best videos I've ever seen! It's the background language and contexts we don't get from tutorials or experimentation, thank you so much!",1
"I'm a young student interested in computers, and I really enjoy your videos every time! Thank you for making these awesome videos!",1
"It's fun how learning is more of a speedrun these days which acts as a very good starter, motivating us to learn the remaining stuff by ourselves and now we have something of a map which we can follow instead of blindly jumping into stuff.",1
Absolute pleasure working on this. Thanks again for the opportunity!,1
"I just started a coding class and the teacher is assuming all of the class already has basic notions of programming. A few of us don't, including myself. This is exactly what I needed. Thank you so much.",1
"Finally, I did it, It took me around 6-7 hours to complete it including making notes and it has been very useful and I am fully satisfied. Thanks, Steven and Shawn.",1
"I've been wanting to learn programming for awhile, but had absolutely no idea of what it all entails. This video really helped to give me that, thanks so much! I'm so excited to start my journey into computer software.",1
"Im in 7th grade, and just wanted to learn how to code. This video is a great introduction to coding for me. Keep up the good work",1
"Studying a Computer Science degree atm and skimmed through this video,  can confirm this is really good and the fact this is free you guys are absolute legends. Good on ya",1
Thank you for this amazing content. Many online courses and bootcamps fail to go over the foundations and this is exactly what we needed,1
"I'm finishing my bachelor's in CS next month and I'm watching this because you never want to forget the fundamentals, you always come back to this stuff.",1
"Hey thanks for all the comments! Yes I agree that I should have added in computer security alongside hacking. It is a huge and important field so I regret leaving it off. And I should also have mentioned interpreters along with compilers as this is an important concept, especially having coded a fair amount of python I have no excuses. I added a couple of notes in the video description.

Thanks for pointing these omissions out, and thanks for all the words of encouragement as well. I was trying something new with the graphic design on this one, trying to match the look to the subject matter and I think it worked out well.",1
Absolutely wonderful.,1
"This color scheme is the most beautiful ever. Dark blue, Neon blue, neon pink, dark purple.... Just beautiful.",1
"I am a final year Computer Science Engineering student and I would like to say, you literally videoed my entire 4 year course work briefly in 10 minutes. Great work.",1
"I started my 'Computer Engineering' course this year, at age 32. Sometimes I feel so bad in the classes, cause I'm ""too old"", and everyone else there is almost teenagers. Also, at this age, everyone expect me to have childrens and a job, not to be in college. But now, watching this video, this made me so PROUND and happy. All of this is too beatifull, and I'll do whatever it takes. Science is my passion since I was a kid, and this is all that really matter.",1
"as a cs student this poured a bucket of passion into me

**Update: I will be a data science intern at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center summer 2022**",1
"Computer science has to be treated like all the other science based subjects such as physics, chemistry or biology.
It's a shame most schools don't take CS as a serious subject.",0
"That moment when you feel like a badass because you knew a little something about every topic he mentioned :D

Great video and great map! Thank you",1
"I remember watching this videos in 2017, i was 13 at the time, now i'm 18 and studying Computer Science, a mad & special thank you dude, it is really an interesting field to study in. you made me find my passion, thank you again.

"The first time I watched this video, I wasn't able to comprehend almost anything (was in my 1st semester in CS).

Today, I'm currently in my 2nd semester of my 2nd year - there's a light in a tunnel. 

What was once pitch black, now is starting to have meaning. CS has both joy and suffering. A complete balance.",1
Now I know that programming can't be learn in 8 minutes,0
I'm currently in my second year and I'm taking both c and java! Great video btw! ❤️,1
"In your video description, you might ""regard"" C as the fastest language, but this isn't always the case. Both C++ and Rust can achieve the same performance even with higher-level language features (zero-cost abstractions). Compiler optimization is a large part of language performance.",1
"Just finished second year CS and glad to find that our curriculum is exactly what he talked about :) and with such a strong foundation, in third year we learn about operating systems, more DS&A, and anything else are at our choosing (ML, AI, computer graphics, general SWE etc)",1
"I like this guy's videos, I probably watched his journey to becoming a Microsoft engineer 5 times",1
"This helped me feel more confident that I'm indeed learning stuff. Even though I still have a long road ahead, it was good to realize half of the concepts already feel familiar.
If I may suggest a video idea: you could do something similar to this but about frameworks, libs, deployers, package managers, compilers, git, docker and all that other tools and weirdly named-stuff that comes with learning a language, because as a beginner all those names are really overwhelming  😥
Thanks for another great content, you're really good explaining stuff!",1
"5:40 Another advantage of two's complement is that addition, subtraction, and multiplication on it are simpler. You just do the same as with unsigned values. One way to explain that is using modular arithmetic: unless you use long arithmetic, numbers are computed modulo 2 to the power of the number of bits in an integer, and the numbers that the same bit string represents in unsigned types and in two's complement are equivalent",1
"What a well laid out video! I'm starting a master's programme in CS at the end of the month after graduating as a BSc in physics, and this video really helped in assuring myself that I'm not in over my head and am actually surprisingly familiar with the topics to come. Of course, I don't mean to underestimate the amount of work to come, but at least I'm more confident now.",1
I just started learning python recently and this video was incredibly helpful. It actually blew my mind how expertly you described these concepts,1
"All I needed was the Child level and was like ""Okay GOT IT. Thank you""",1
"Wow... I love how he explains things and especially his ""aura""--calming and not judgmental. Imho, pure of the intention to ""I want to help you to understand this"". Honestly, it has been a very long time I haven't feel this feeling. Very soothing...",1
"As a final year computer science student, I still barely understand “Np complete” but this explanation is super useful! It’s like abstraction.",1
"I LOVE the expression of pride and admiration and excitement on the interviewer's face when talking with the grad student. He's soooo happy that someone up-and-coming really gets it. ^___^ I don't get it completely, but I'm glad there are people out there who love to learn and love when others learn, too. Fantastic.",1
I wish all my teachers taught me things like how this guy taught the child. Simple and effective.,1
It amazes me how passionate the conversation got when the grad student got on...I've not heard a real and genuine math conversation in a while...appreciate y'all,1
And so it begins... procrastinating on my actual studies to learn something different from crash course,0
"Love the material, love the host. It's clear to me that you really love this topic, and you're articulate and passionate. I'm so excited for this series! Thank you!",1
I would really love it if crash course would make a course about teaching us how to program where in each episode they teach us about the basics of one language,1
"I feel like I've just taken an awesome short course that's quite easy to follow and packed with interesting knowledge, and totally free! Awesome, can't wait to see the next one!",1
"Ahhh I am super excited to follow this series!! I have had my mind set on becoming a video game designer for a while, and this series gives me the opportunity to learn the basics of computer science! Thank you :D",1
I'm so happy you guys are doing this! I'm a software developer and I absolutely love the videos you guys do. I'm really looking forward to the rest of this series!,1

"As a professional software engineer, lemme tell you that the whole bit about having to be good at finding the answer on Google is 100% true",1
"Agreed with Patrick. CS is more about theoretical knowledge, whereas most of the people are going to deal with application level programming which requires more application level knowledge. I think Software Engineering course suits the needs of most of the people in this regard.",1
"Computer Science gives you a language to communicate your technical ideas as well as a framework and tools to evaluate them. And while you can learn programming/development by watching a bunch of Youtube videos, if you lack the basic CS knowledge, you will always struggle to make technical choices & come up with a poor/suboptimal design. While this is understandable that for some people the CS curriculum means a lot of depth which it certainly is, it has big rewards on your software engineering job once you learn it well. 
It is easy to supplement knowledge related to the latest trending technology, but if you have knowledge gaps in your fundamentals, you're gonna have a hard time overcoming those.",1
Its odd that everyone knows college is nearly useless yet every business requires you to have it just to be considered for an interview.,0
Thanks Patrick. I raised 3 great kids. My youngest is majoring in CS where I’m not qualified to mentor him. Been letting you handle that for me since 2018! Now my whole family loves your videos. Many thanks for sharing your wisdom on tech and general life advice. Wishing you all the best.,1
"TechLead this is a fantastic video, very well done. In my experience as a physics major with a minor in math and computer science. I found that there are classes in every major that use computers and computer programming extensively. In math we used programming to model complex physical systems that you could never do with out numerical analysis.  In physics we had a year lab where we made our own high speed data capture card.  We programmed it to capture data and then we wrote programs to analyze and display that data. I think you are 100% correct when you state that the act of programming is very important for every discipline.",1
"I was really under a lot of stress and pressure to pursue a masters degree and I was thinking of doing a computer science degree since I had a bachelors in it too. But just like you said, apart from 1 or 2 courses here, the other courses are havoc. The photographer example was spot on. This video REALLY helped me change my perspective. Thanks a lot. I really feel like this video was tailor made for me. Thanks again ! Subscribed, ofc :)",1
"for me, what got my career in coding started was my experience as a student programmer for a company near my university that hired me on basically as an intern. They hired me because I worked for them on my Senior capstone project (fall semester) so I worked for them as an intern during my last semester, through that following summer, and then I landed my first full time job in the fall. I would have stayed with them had they been talking to me and expressed interest in actually treating me like an actual employee.",1
"i agree with everything you're saying, but how come you don't highlight the greatest gift of a computer science degree? problem solving. 

i struggled through school, but now looking back, im actually very glad i took these courses. for one, it taught me the limits of my knowledge and how much there is to learn. taking these classes don't make you an expert in the field. instead, it teaches introduces you to the fundamentals in the broad field of computer science. armed with this fundamental knowledge, you can have a much clearer perspective of how the pieces come together and allows you to problem solve better. 

sure, it doesn't teach you the practical skills, but problem-solving is an essential skill for any career especially in tech. when you strip away all the fancy frameworks and the technologies that come and go, at the core, what you have is computer science which you can use to build these solutions.",1

"I love how relatable your comment was “that your grades were average for CS” one of the reasons why I didn’t go the CS route was because I didn’t think I had good enough grades to get through it. When I think back at it, I should have done it anyways",1
"Very transparent YouTuber, always great content, I’m an accountant major and I love your videos",1
I don’t know anything about software engineering but I still watched the whole video. I’m always down to any content!,1
"I just started and I am a freshman, it makes me feel a lot better to know that someone else didn't have their resume ready. I started HTML, CSS, and JS on my own and am doing to website/resume thing now so I can practice web development all through out college along with other stuff that I learn so I can put all of my projects on there kind of like a show case.",1
"Dear Jed, I'm a ComSci student but I don't really watch you because you're into Computer Science, but I watch you just because. 
I really enjoy your daily vlogs and videos, obviously its a plus when computer science is involved, just like when you made that messaging app that looks like discord. My point is that don't be too conscious of your viewers and just make videos and follow your heart!",1
"Love your content jedcal, keep it up. I appreciate your honesty in showing the grades you received, including explaining the courses that stood out to you during your attendance at BU.

Edit: It for sure makes me more comfortable with my academic performance - how I'm not the only average guy out there.",1
"I know I'm two years late to see this, but I hope you read it. 

Thanks for making this. I'm probably going into computer science and I had no idea what my options were. This helps out things into perspective and honestly makes me more confident about pursuing this degree because it seems like I have pretty good options.",1
Man your channel is fire finally someone who knows what people is looking for,1
"These videos are awesome, man ! If I may ask, what do/did you study ? I, myself, am studying computer science right now and I can say that these videos are really helpful for someone who is in doubt about what they want to do. Keep up the good work ! :D",1
I'm thinking about getting into a computer career. This is my first time hearing like different titles about working on computers. Thank you so much for sharing this video. I just need to find the right title that will fit me with dealing with computers because I like working all computers.,1
Awesome! I'm transferring from a community college with an Associates in Science into the CIT program at my local university. I've never been that great at math and after watching your video I think system administration or networking would probably be the best for me.,1
"I loved this video...very well done and refreshing compared to the other ""Career Overview"" videos I've seen for Computer Science. I have a degree in Biology and have already written down those genetics companies you mentioned so that I can see their job posts, and if I have a potential future in bioinformatics by the time I get some CS classes under my belt. Honestly the CS industry as a whole seems like a playground - so many interesting things: security, cryptography, image/video rendering, mobile app development, new algorithms. Thank you again.",1
"Your channel is f*ing awesome, bro! I've been thinking about studying science or computer science so that's exactly what I needed :) Keep it up :D",1
"I love your videos, man! Mechanical Engineering sounded really apealing to me at first, but after seeing the mech eng, Elec eng, and CS videos, I'm thinking Electrical Engineering with a focus on electronics or computers sounds more like me. May also minor in CS... But idk yet. Thanks for making these!",1
"I totally agree on internships! I am a graduating senior in Computer Engineering, and I have done 4 internships. Internships really showed me what working was really like, and helped me find where I want to work. Despite being in the depressed COVID economy, I already have a job offer lined up for when I graduate in December!",1
Also don’t forget to code outside of class and work on projects that interest you.,1
"I think that’s what I’m most afraid of – getting internships early. I’m currently a freshman in college majoring in CS, and I have little to no knowledge about coding. So, when I try to apply for internships, I’m afraid that these jobs that an intern does will involve hacking Amazon’s database or something wild.",0
"Dude looks like he works at a surf board shop in Florida, chills with his friends at the beach on the weekends while listening to glam metal.  And knows how to enjoy life better than anyone in this comment section",1
"Right, when I got into my first CS class in college I was expecting to learn a bunch of programming languages, but in reality we just learnt only the concepts and wrote a 10 line program in C++ for two days, and never did any other programming.

That first CS class made me hate CS. Because the material was way too quick. I started reading the first 3 chapters while taking detailed notes of every paragraph, and then it got too overwhelming since I was spending nearly 10 hours for each chapter just taking notes each week. I didn’t have enough time so I stopped reading the textbook all together and started to hate it because I was just memorizing the concepts without actually understanding their uses. I understood how they worked, but not at all their applications.

My advice: read the textbook briefly and don’t read every word, so that you won’t become overwhelmed and stop reading all together.",0
"One of the biggest things people should take into consideration if they’re gonna pursue any IT jobs or anything related to CS is that it never ends. You’ll constantly be trying to keep up with the latest tech or wondering if you need to bring getting the newest CompTIA cert or if your current if good enough. It’s a rough life especially if you’re married or in a relationship, it’s just constantly hours in front of the screen.",0
the videos on this channel are so great! it's really a pity that you don't seem to be creating content anymore :(,1
Nice work! The animations did a great job of illustrating your points and it was well presented and explained. I really enjoyed it! :),1
This is an awesome video! I haven't found anything else that gives such a good intro to the P?=NP problem,1
"i don't know a lot about computer science, but your visuals and the way you formulate the argument are very good",1
I don't have a computer but it seems very helpful so I hope soon to get one ☺️ 😜🤠 I like how it teaches you about it so fascinating,1
Learning how to code helps your everyday logic tremendously. You'll learn how to think more efficiently.,1
"If you want to motivate people for your subject, your goal should not be to show them how simple it is, but instead how deep it is!",1
"I'll definitely teach my kids about computer science.

Thanks for the priceless knowledge 🙂",1
What a brilliant speaker. I appreciate that he stood and didn't move. The effect was I listened instead of being distracted by him moving and gesturing. As a result of his presentation I intend to take his advice to learn more about computer science. Thank you Hadi Partovi for being a person who has changed the world with your passion and knowledge.,1
I'm also a computer science graduate from Iran and i'm completely agree with the transformation of this field which is happening to the world.,1
"What I love about computer programming in particular, is that unlike any other subject taught in schools, this one forces students to use the creative and logical parts of their brains for once. What every country needs for success is smart people that can come up with solutions, so I believe computer programming is something that should be taught from early on in order to train young minds. Of course it's not for everyone, I know people who won't understand it no matter how they explain it to them, but then again mindless memorizing is not for everyone either.",1
"Last year, I helped 4th and 5th grade students participate in Hour of Code. This year, our second graders got involved, as did a class of special needs middle school students. Our students are begging to do more and I am going to give them as many opportunities as I can!",1
"I agree. Another thing that would be nice is more integration of computers into the rest of the classes. For example, math classes could teach Excel graphs and formulas.",1
"As a computer science major who will soon be working in NYC as a software engineer, I agree with many of the points in this video. My first-year salary will exceed $100k after only a bachelor's degree. Although this is due to a combination of several internships done during college,  the cost of living in New York, and sheer luck and blessings, many of my peers are also finding roles with great compensation.

if any high schoolers, college students, or even people out of school are considering learning how to code, I strongly urge you all to make the leap.",1
"One of my classmates from college was a former software developer.
He managed to break into the field without a CS degree but the company he worked for
had to downsize. They decided to lay off all employees who didn't have a 4-year degree. 
It's an anecdotal example but having a degree in CS or a related field is a good 
investment for increased job security within such a volatile field of work.",1
"Doing my cs degree right now. Not gonna lie, it sure ain't easy but it's definitely something I love doing!",1
"Short answer: yes. 

Graduated with one in December 2018. Now I make 80K at my job as a Full Stack Engineer. The best strategy is the degree and an internship or paid work to get a job. It was well worth it.",1
"Thanks man. This reassured me that even if my entrepreneurial ventures go to shit, my CS degree is a good safety net.",1
I'm a Computer Science major and a few months away for graduation. Your videos have helped me out. Great job keep it up!!,1
"We need these types of videos in veterinary and nursing degrees, there are so many misconceptions about the two fields your help and expertise would be great",1
"It's been 4 years since graduating with my computer engineering degree. Pay is amazing. Benefits are amazing. Flexibility is amazing. The projects are (usually) interesting. There are so many openings in computing. There are so many business opportunities as well. It's absolutely insane! I think companies are really, really desperate for talent right now. I got lucky ending up in Silicon Valley but there is no doubt in my mind that the degree is extremely lucrative anywhere in the developed world. At my university, computer engineering was 85% computer science, 15% electrical/electronics engineering. It's functionally equivalent to computer science as far as the industry is concerned. I chose to take robotics electives in school but don't actually use those skills in my job. I'm just a standard software developer/engineer. Haha.

I have a friend who went the boot camp route and struggled a lot in the field, being the first target during layoffs and having to learn A TON of stuff that boot camps just don't cover. With some tutoring and some years of on-the-job training he is doing OK now, too. I'd definitely recommend the degree route as it lays the complete foundation and gives you the flexibility to learn about some of the more advanced specializations like machine learning, artificial intelligence, programming languages, computer graphics, game development, distributed systems, and more in a controlled learning environment with ample timing before jumping straight into the subset of the industry you're interested in.",1
"Man, loving these 'breakthrough' videos! It's feels fulfilling to see the progress being made! I mean, finally modelling quantum gravity? jeez!",1
Glad to have been a contributing member to this field had  my first peer reviewed paper published in IEEE this year :),1
"Slight correction. The infinite limit of shallow neural networks as kernel machines (specifically Gaussian processes) was established in 1994 (Radford Neal). This was updated for 'ReLU' non-linearities in 2009 (Cho & Saul). In 2017 Lee & Bahri showed this result could be extended to deep neural networks. Not sure this counts as ""2021's biggest breakthrough"", though it is a cool result, so happy to have it publicised. 👍",1
I appreaciate the efforts in trying to make these heavily technical subjects understandable to the general public. Thank you all : ),1
It's crazy that we've been able to do so much with deep neural networks and we are only now starting to figure out how they work,1
"Mathematics is like that wind your sail boat needs to move way ahead on your journey. This was so heart warming to watch. There is really a thin line between maths and magic!
Thanks a lot Quanta Magazine for this beautiful summary! loved it!",1
I have been using these kernel vector spaces for QML recently and this is one of those mathemagics I honestly adore!,1
It's crazy how much stuff from uni started flowing back watching this. The fact that I can actually be able to understand all these complicated maths is crazy but exciting,1
These videos are severely underrated- Thank you for the knowledge you share and hopefully millions of people will be watching these per week- It's so good for people to know about these things,1
Shane your video got me to major in computer science last year. Now I have a great internship! Thank you!,1
"18 months ago I started a SOC (Security Operations Center) internship which turned into a full-time job even before getting my CS degree in August 2021. In a week I start as an Information Security Engineer making $90k/yr in the Mountain West region. They needed somebody who had a computer science background and experience in cybersecurity. 

So many good career paths from a bachelor's in CS. But the key in my experience to making the most of your degree is developing your soft skills and being hungry to learn more.",1
Shane - thank you for what you do! It is very helpful. Could you do a video on benefits on minoring in computer Science,1
"Your videos are complete! Thank you for helping us young entrepreneurs who aspire to get out of this norma cycle and create our own skills, habits, and connections.😤💙💪🏽",1
"Hello Shane, why dont u make a video about careers with good work-life balance? That'd be wonderful♥️",1
"You are one of the best youtubers ever man, thank you so much for your information.",1
"*CORRECTION* AT 1:27 the graph says ""Quinary System"" but then the graph shows 10 possible states - which is actually decimal. Technically, there should be only 5 possible values there, but the overall concept is still the same. NOTE: Since we can't use annotations in our videos going forward if we find any smallish errors in our videos like this we'll leave clarifications in the episode description. Thanks all for the wonderful feedback! -brandon",1
I am a third year majoring in computer engineering and this video explains transistors and logic gates better than a semester class.,1
It must be basic as hell for comp scientists or philosophers but this was fascinating.,1
Bit at the end made me wonder if I'm merely a computer. Great episode! -John,1
"Unlike most CS introductions, Crash Course does a great job in giving the student context, explaining how computers function at a fundamental level before applying layers of abstraction. Very well done --  As a Sophomore ComputerSci major, I'm excited to see more enriching content every week(:",1
Just passing by to say that I'm loving her course and excellent diction.,1
"Just wanted to say I love the themed animations for this series. The computer UI, old Mac OS UI, etc. Always great work to the animators and team.",1
"A good video as always! As a CS major myself, this is actually finally a series where I can answer questions and stuff in the comment section! Just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info:

1) There are also not versions of all the gates. AND, OR, and XOR become NAND, NOR, XNOR, respectively. They are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate. While they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs, they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts. You often here people verbally NAND and XNOR when talking about logic, so I think it is interesting to note even though this isn't computer engineering.

2) While by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false, this is often not the case when we actually look at real components. Because of power usage, the opposite is often used. Generally, the more common output is set to 0.

3) 0 doesn't actually mean nothing is flowing through. For example, we may set our 1 to 5 volts, and our 0 to 2.3 volts. This allows for us to have an ""off"" state at 0 volts. We wouldn't want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off! There are also other uses for this state, but this may be covered in a future video.",1
"Oh my god, THANK YOU for clearly explaining how each logic gate is physically represented in an electrical circuit.  A lot of that abstraction makes it really daunting and hard for dummies like me to get it through our thick heads.",0
My first real exposure and application of logic gates was in Minecraft with Redstone,1
"Advice to all beginner programmers: computer science is not that hard, it just takes time and effort!",1
We dont want over qualified students to intimidate others....... wow thats the best and honest thing I ever heard from a professor. No wonder MIT is a top institution. The level of deliverance of education is way too perfect.,1
This dude is an absolute legend. Spitting wisdom and working the class like a bad crowd on an open mic night and the 872 thumbs down are from unemployed Harvard students.,1
"This is amazing. Who could have thought, that one day i can just sit at my home in another continent and at the same time to attend an MIT course. Fascinating ! Thank You !",1
"Wow, MIT professors are much more engaging than my local state college...",1
"I know I can never get in to MIT, so this is such a useful  free resource for people like me who want to get into comp sci taught by masters! Thank you so much! I plan on getting either a second bachelors in comp sci (first one in music) or master's if possible.",1
I learn more here than in my actual lectures at uni. this is great. also i love videos because you can pause and go back if you need to,1
This is beautiful. Thank you MIT OCW and thank you Professors Grimson and Guttag for the clear and concise lectures.,1
"These professors seem awesome, my college professors make me feel like I'm in high school again with docked points for not showing up even if you have an A.  Kind of hard to not miss a day when you work and have a family.",1
"I just graduated with Honors in Computer Science in September, and I already landed a really cool software engineering job at a big and prestigious tech company! So excited!",1
I like the positivity you bring into computer science.  Im going into my second year and I am really enjoying the major so far. Great videos,1
I’m currently in my senior year of hs and planning to major in cs. I’ve been programming on and off for about 2 years and plan to be a software engineer. Your videos are great man 💯👍🏿,1
"I'm a senior computer science student and I have been programming ever since I was 12, although I definitely agree that computer science is the best major ever (maybe the best that ever existed) but the problem I see that a lot of people are getting into computer science just for the money, or just for the fact it is really popular right now and not for the fact that they are interested in computers and technology in general.",1
"I love how people have interships in big companies like Microsoft, google, etc. And in my country there’s no companies like those :(
I live in Venezuela a very poor country I only want to have my degree and get out of this shithole",0
"#7: Diversity of options, man you can work on so many things as a programmer. Super exciting fields like games or movies. There are jobs in solar and basic betterment of mankind. Or like, Facebook and Google for money.",1
"I’m doing CS to be a software engineer, currently in 2nd year of college😄",1
"I'm a Computer Engineering student going to 2nd year now. So far we have tackled Computer System Servicing, Programming(C++ & Java), and other minor and major engineering subjects. I have no experience with programming, but I was able to do just fine. Calculus was the only hard subject I took so far, which is offered in every engineering courses. 

We are going to tackle more about electronics, robotics, and computer architecture in the higher years.

So if you're feeling to take Computer Engineering, go ahead, it's a good degree.",1
"I was a Computer Science major but I switched to Computer Engineering last year. There really isn't much programming after your first 3 semesters in CS, after that it's all theory, which is great for the few that want to work in academia. Computer Engineering actually allows me to apply my learned programming skills to projects, whether inside or outside of class. This is why I made the switch and have no regrets!",1
"I’m an ex-CS and Math/Stats student, who actually just switched his double major to Actuarial Science and Maths/Stats. The reason being was because I found out that CS is only about 30% programming, the rest of it is theory of CS and various other theoretical, math-related CS courses like Advanced Algorithms and Theory of Computation (which I’m personally not interested in). If you really don’t find a lot of interest in algorithms, data structures, and theory of cs, as viable as it is, this major may most probably not be for you. If you love programming, but don’t find the in-depth CS stuff interesting, I’d encourage you to instead self-teach programming or go through a coding bootcamp. Computer programming is only a tool in CS, like math is a tool in Physics :)",0
"Both are S or A tier degrees honestly, so anyone who picks either of them will be fine. Great salary and job growth.
Thanks for the videos as always, Shane!",1
I just graduated high school and was stuck between choosing CE and CS THANK YOU for the perfect timing. You should compare these 2 with electrical engineering,1
I actually dropped out of CS the first time around. I had no idea what I was getting myself into lol. I stomped it later in life though 😂,0
"Hey Shane, love your videos!
Can you make a video on the best specializations to go into for Computer Science?",1
I chose a 'Computer Science with Software Engineering' degree and the doors of opportunity 🚪 have been opening ever since.,1
imposter syndrome is SO REAL! i think that ties back in a lot to your first question- all of us out here have imposter syndrome because we don't realize everyone else is working so hard!,0
Currently a bio major on a pre med track. COVID had me rethinking my career choices this past year and now looking at switching to computer science. This was some really good insight!  Thank you,1
"I appreciated this so much. The problem I'm having is knowing where to focus. I am a jack of all trades when it comes to most things I do and I feel so overwhelmed looking at job descriptions that require different skills all relating to computer science. There have been a couple things that I really enjoyed, but they didn't relate to coding as much which makes me question if this was right for me. All I can do is continue practicing in areas that interest me and look for a job that asks for that.",1
oh my goodness. I needed this video for years. I graduated 14 years ago. I have also struggled with imposter syndrome. In recent years I finally started vocalizing that I didn't enjoy coding.  I felt like a rather intelligent person until I got into the deep coursework of my computer science degree. I love how honest and open you are about this and it's going to help so many students who are currently in the thick of this difficult degree.,1
I'm about to enroll in a CIS program. I wanted to know studying tips and useful tools to help me get better at coding and what I should expect to study. I really appreciate your help. I'm trying to be more confident and believe I can do this,1
"That was soo helpful thank you soo much. And I never knew this syndrome was a thing, but just you talking about it made me fear the major so much more knowing that ive gone through this so much during school and college, feeling like the dumbest one in class. Ill take your advice, and thanks for letting me know im not alone!",1
"Thank you so much for sharing your insights into comp sci! I'm starting my degree this September, and your video definitely helped me prepare for what to expect. <3",1
"Hi first of all great video, i’m a freshman in my second semester of computer science and i’m kind of struggling, i definitely feel the imposter syndrome and i want to practice more but i’m not sure where to look. I’ve only learned a bit of java so far and i was going thru leet code and couldn’t really find anything for java. do u have any recommendations?",0
This was so helpful thank you so much for sharing from your heart and being so encouraging!! 🥰🥰 “you are meant to be what you want to be”,1
"I’m kinda undecided on my major, I’ve thought about optometry but I don’t want to do 8 years of school. My mom and dad are software engineers but it’s never really been my passion, do you think a CS degree is worth it? Like especially with jobs and stuff after graduating, are you able to still enjoy or have free time?",0
"Here’s a story for you beginners , I went into my first class of cse with no knowledge of coding, I got a C in intro to Java, okay yeah I did bad but then I wanted to get better so I did some practice over the winter to improve my logic, okay B in the next highest class the following semester, Software 1. Then over the summer I was able to learn so many other languages, Swift, Python, JavaScript. I had all this growth in a little under a year. All I’m saying is if you guys are worried about being a beginner who doesn’t know how to code, and don’t think it will get easier. Trust me, it gets easier, do simple personal projects to help yourself get the flow of implementing your own logic in things like (it else’s, while for loops etc) to help you gain a feel of how they work. I would struggle on projects during the semester on how to make a blackjack game in java, as a beginner this is a daunting task for me. So over winter break I made projects such as, modeling a Car in java, okay what functions does a car have, accelerate, decelerate, break, etc. from then I could think of variables, okay what could toggle a car being on or off? Oh a boolean! Oh maybe my car should run only when the gas level is greater than zero, okay that’s loop there, with gas level modeled as an int. See things like this slowly helped my logic grow, and now I can tackle any language or problem my class throws at me. Trust me  I’m still a beginner as well, but I ended up catching up to the kids around me when I was once behind, and in times when you feel like giving up, please don’t, I urge you to stick through it because it does get easier.",1
"As someone who’s graduated and has been in the field for a couple of years, this guy is giving some really good advice that I wish I would’ve had when I first started",1
"I would add two things:
- work in group as often as possible
- have a hobby that you can enjoy without having to stare at a screen",1
"""your classmate are not better/worse"". 
This really motivate me because I felt like everybody in my class have experience in coding and stuff and afraid to be left behind..
Now I felt more confident.

Thank you!!!",1
"On the first point: I had been coding since 7th grade and I had plenty of classmates who hadn't coded ever when I started college. For those of you in the latter position, we don't judge your for not knowing programming. We are glad you are trying to learn and many of us want to help you! I love inviting friends over to my dorm and helping them out with assignments and group studying. You don't need to be scared of us or embarrassed that you aren't a flawless coder, we aren't either and the skill we have we had to put in work for as well, and we want to help you get to that point as well! We're all at school to learn, and if I can help others I will, I hope once I get to upper division classes that those friends will help me as well when they inevitably get to a point where they are better than me at certain things! You can't be the best at everything

Also for the book thing, as a math major (double majoring), I have a nagging need to buy every book for every class. They are expensive, but it fills me with pure joy to have a library of math and CS textbooks in my room. I am willing to skip on a game or two for a textbook, both provide me with entertainment because I am weird lol",1
"Here is my story: I’m currently thirteen years old and have been programming for a year. I started off with the basics of C for a few months, then I moved on to Python (I’m currently a Python intermediate) and now I started learning Java. I think what kept me going was practicing and building my own projects. I was fascinated by the cool games and projects I can create, and that made programming even more enjoyable to me. I would also recommend finding a coding partner or a coding club (as suggested in this video) because you can help each other out and build projects together. I personally wasn’t able to find a coding partner of a coding club since not many kids my age know how to code.",1
"Hey man, I just started my Computer science journey at UCF about a month ago and I was wondering if you ever found a specific time during the day or night where you find yourself to be the most efficient with coding. In other words do you have a time during the day where you just shut everything down and force yourself to just stop programming for the day or is it usually different for you every day? I loved this video I really related to feeling pretty lost my first 2 weeks as I had no programming experience at all but am finally really starting to get the hang of things. My professor for my Intro to C class has been constantly repeating that 80% of the learning in this class will be outside of the classroom and I have found that to be some real truth.",1

"Good to have you back Forrest. I've been following you since I started chasing my degree. I am now coming up on the completion of my associates in Computer Science and Math from my community college and then transferring to a university to chase a bachelors. I feel like I know barely anything about coding because all of my general education classes are so demanding. Did you feel this way? I am really looking forward to only learning programming and computer-focused information because although I am finally in a Java class, Chemistry 2 is kicking my ass and takes all my time. Thanks.",1

"High school students who want to go to STEM majors in college should watch your videos. You cover subjects in-depth with practical examples. This is what is lacking in the majority of career/major prep videos on Youtube. The other channels would say ""you need to know math"" but are not really specific like you.

This TED Talk encouraged me to go into computer science. Now I'm in my second year in college and I love it,1
"I think she's talking about software engineering education, not computer science education. Math is an integral part of computer science, because math is the language of science. If you took math from computer science, by definition, you took science out of computer science, which is quite bizarre.",0
Wow this was amazing watching and would like my instructor to be like her. She is to the point and understands that needing more programmers. I am just getting started and it is all about problem solving,1
"Computer science is a medium for problem solving and self-expression - Ashely Gavin
I like her definition.",1
"The first TED talk I've seen in years that was good, even great. There were some inaccuracies about CS but note that the vocabulary varies by region, school, and nation. If definitions were your main takeaway then the video is not meant for you.",1
"I did python tutorial after python tutorial and none of it ever stuck. It wasnt until it really mattered at my job that I was pushed to learn basic computer science principles, and not long after that -Python. And I love every single part of it.",1
Although she’s wrong about the math part. I definitely believe that professors like to make learning CS harder than it should be.,0
update: i switched my major to mathematics. I guess CS was not for me xD,0
"It took me like 7 years to get my undergraduate. I felt dumb all the time. I'm glad pushed through. I'm a Data Engineer and a lot of the stuff I found impossible before is easy now. I graduated with a 2.5 GPA. A lot of my teachers and the dean tried to convince me to change my major, but I never gave up. Practice makes perfect",1
The math shouldn’t scare you away. I was terrible at math. I just applied myself and made it. Not bad at all. It just takes effort.,1
"""It's 2019 there's no way you're bad at computers"" 
You've clearly never worked in tech support.",0
"You lost me at math-heavy. Thank you for this information, considering choosing another degree now",1
"I'm a first year CS student at a major German university and my current classes are introduction to programming, computer architecture, automata theory, calculus and linear algebra. I went into it not having a background in CS at all, I really only went into it because I have a thing for logic and structure and I don't regret my decision at all! At the beginning I was worried because I didn't know how to code at all and I had to put in some extra hours in the beginning compared to the kids who have been doing this since they were in infant but it's totally possible.",0
"CS requires a person who is patient, persistent, creative in solutions... Basically not someone who sees a wall and says i am done. That's how you can know. Further as you grow into CS you will find out that you have been taught how to solve any problem, even if not from this field: think, research, learn, craft. Every experience that you go through will you improve at those steps. You will graduatelly stumble across moments where you will be overwhelmed, and it's ok, because you also learn that progress is through error after error, only for the new problem to come to you, and apply the same process; you already can handle being overwhelmed.",1
"To add to this - CS is also a major for those who like to practice outside the classroom, I am a current CS major at Lawrence Technological University and the majority of my programming practice came from implementing the techniques taught in class to personal projects outside of the curriculum, I believe this is an important element to the CS degree path in order to get really good.",1
I can't believe this is free online to watch and learn you guys are doing great things. I deafinetly  want to be a computer scientist now,1
"This series is a great addition to learning computer science, i.e. learning syntax, logic, algorithms. 
It gives context to everything, besides, it's fascinating.",1
"Loving the series, CC! Does anyone know any reference material where one can learn these algorithms?",1
"Ah yes, the graph:  depth-first vs breadth-first search.  I also quite enjoyed the binary search tree (BST).  Really fascinating field of algorithms and data structures.  :)",1
"This video was incredibly well done!  This lady is really great at teaching material in a clear, easy-to-follow manner.",1
"I've always thought it interesting how differently sorting algorithms work to how we, as humans, seem to sort things; it seems like we're much more efficient than many of the algorithms (at least the ones I've seen, which is admittedly few). For example, when we look at all the items, we remember what we saw before and can change more than one thing at once (e.g. ""oh, I remember that was the smallest before I found the actual smallest, so that's the second smallest. Let me put both of them first and second right now, saving myself a re-look""). I know computers are still faster in the end, but I suspect that's because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data (and possibly our brain has a slower ""clock speed""), rather than computational efficiency. Anyone know if that's true?

Has anyone made a ""human sort"" algorithm, so to speak, that sorts the way we do, including our little ""tricks""? (I'm guessing no). If not, are there any algorithms that at least take advantage of a trick or two, like the one I just described?",1
"In school I had to write a bubble sort in 16bit intel ASM. It worked, was efficient and was well documented. It got me an A+. Even like 15 years later, I am so damn proud of that piece of code. :-D",1
"We got ourselves a 2-in-1 video, with one of those parts talking about the 2-in-1 laptop lol I swear I just thought of that. Hope y'all enjoy!

Edit: If you are considering the LG Gram, check out the new one with the 11th Gen Intel CPU and the new Intel Evo Series! To learn all about that, check out my new video: https://youtu.be/h2548d3GrpY",1
"Can't stress ""Making more CS Friends"" enough! 😉",1
"As a college student this video was really great for me... with everything happening due to COVID-19 it really slowly made me lose my desire to ""immerse"" in CS, and I didn't fully realize it until I heard you say it. Thanks for all the advice you put out!",1
"Out of all the Tech YouTubers I know, I really think Forrest gives the most practical advice for getting in the industry. Thank you for that🙏🏾",1
"You're one of the best and most favorite computer science / programming mentors of all time, Forrest. I really cherish all your videos man. You're Godsend.",1
"What you need to succeed in CS
A laptop.
A Calculator.
A good IDE.
And the ability to think in abstract terms.
That's it.",1
"I wish that I had a video like this when I was at university.  Seven years too late unfortunately.  But even so, this video is still useful for learning Computer Science and programming through online courses.  Like at the moment.",1
"Hi Forrest, thanks for making all these videos about CS. It’s really helpful for me. I am about to take my CS degree next year. I’m planning to get 2-3 internship during my 3 years of college degree. Do you think this is possible?",1
Your content is a clear demonstration of how much passion and energy you put in making these videos. Thanks for such awesome content!,1
I was unable to take admission to an engineering college to pursue Software Engineering due to my financial conditions. But I never lost hope I am studying on my own self and I feel privileged that I came to know about your channel. Thank you so much for such valuable content.,1
"If everyone was like you, study wouldn't not be tough. Thank you for this video and graph theory explanation. What you made is not just knowledge, but enlightment for me. You do it like its a cake to you, and I actually understand your explanation.",1
"This is a great channel, definitely will get much more recognitions in the future!",1
"This is by far the best video regarding graph theory I have seen in my (quite long) life. Extremely clear, extremely accurate and extremely useful. As ""Einstein Newton"" here said 8 months ago, this can be considered the 3Blue1Brown of Computer Science. Congratulations!",1
3Blue1Brown of Computer Science. Brilliant video.,1
"There is a small mistake at 4:15 
You would need to connect every point on a column with every other point on the same column same for the rows. Otherwise a graph coloring algorithm wouldn't work here, since graph coloring algorithms only test for the constraint that each neightbor has a different color.",0
"Dude the way of explained this topic is so amazing and you made it look so easy to understand, It is so hard to understand this topic from books for someone like me. Thanks alot for your help. GOD bless!!",1
Beautifully explained and easily understandable to someone who knows little to nothing about graph theory or computer science. Keep up the good work!,1
This is going to be one of the most popular study channel in the future ♥️,1
"This day in the life video felt really refreshing compared to most other ""day in the life"" videos; seems like a great mix of both productive grinding and fun hangouts with friends. Keep it up!! :D",1
My boy is a fully fledged celebrity. Glad to watch another one of your videos!,1
"Hey Nick, the vibe amongst your friends and you is great! Love this video!",1
"Hey nick, good video. I've been a software Dev for a while and I got to say, your vlog just confirmed that university hasn't changed since I was there. It's really nice to see the perspective of a student/junior Dev, helps keep me up to date on how you guys feel/learn/think when I see you for an internship or your first job, so don't give up on YouTube man, it's way more useful than you might think. Good job

While I'm at it, feel free to reach out if you ever want a second opinion on some of your code,, it will be my pleasure.",1
Dude all the walking back forth to get those shots of you walking haha. Props to you man,1
nicholas t is the best youtuber ever. Every one of his videos brings a smile to my face,1
"Watching this makes me miss my first 3 uni years 😭

Had so much fun",1
the waterloo campus looks beautiful! really makes me want to visit,1
man i love how wholesome ur friends are!,1
"Your videos are insane, the amount of effort that goes into compiling all this information, making it digestible for the average viewer and ALSO having it be interesting? On top of that the insane amount of editing and graphic work to make it coherent and fun to watch? You're going places man, love it.",1
"I’m currently studying compilers and language design, I make programming languages basically, and your explanation of high-level languages to assembly was very good. It was simple and easy to understand, I’m definitely yoinking it.",1
"As a CS major, this is amazing work. I particularly liked the part about graphics rendering. The explanations are not only consistently clear; they are concise, which is a non-trivial feat.",1
"I wish more people appreciate the insane amount of effort went into making this video. The writing, scripting, animating, editing, voicing. Absolutely brilliant",1
"As a computer science student, I love the fact that there's no clickbait, you know your topic and explain it very clearly. You earned yourself a new subscriber",1
"Even knowing most of this information, the way you simplify it and make it so clear is really impressive. This is super well made and entertaining 👍",1
its insane that you have 3 videos and are doing this well that just proves that your content is amazing keep it up,1
I've been stuck in tutorial hell for so long. At the moment I can code any mockup in HTML and CSS and Javascript is a challenge. I deleted every tutorial on my PC and decided to take this course. Week 0 blew my mind. The problem solving approach is what I love. It teaches you to problem solve and build things on your own.,1
"Strongly Agree... 
When I started my journey as a programmer. CS50 was my first course and I learned everything online from Net Ninja tutorials, W3schools, Clever Programmers, and so on.
Now I am a Mobile and Web app developer. 
Yeah, I can say it is possible to learn Computer Science without a degree...
And, I'm Self Taught Software Engineer too. Buddy",1
great video. as a beginner programmer i agree with most things you say. one unspoken rule of programming is to google *everything* you dont understand. its simply the only way one learns.,1
I totally agree with him. Before joining this course I couldn't even attend a 50 min class in my uni with my full conscious. But I attended their first class of approx 5 hours with full interest. So if you want to learn Python or Web or AI or CS  basics which he mentioned in the video do give them a try. It's worth it.,1
"Yes, this is what was able to get me to wrap my head around coding. For anyone that's getting deeper into learning web dev stuff, I highly recommend Scrimba. It has a great problem-solving based approach to learning where you get small challenges constantly so you can come up with the solution by tying what you've learned together instead of just showing you the solution first. There's also some really cool tech on their platform where you get a live integrated cloud-based coding environment with all of the source files for each challenge automatically updated as you go through the course so it's very seamless and the video tutorial part of it is not a video but instead is a scripted live editing of the code in the text editor. You can pause it at any time and directly edit the code that's being written during the tutorial.",1
"First of all, congratulations, you've earned around 40 subs in the last 2 hours; from 12.9K to 13.3K! Second of all, I love your content and the  fact that you've encouraged me and many others to take this course is amazing. I've been doing frontend for 4 months now and sometimes I struggle with some programing concepts in JavaScript so...I'm enrolling now.",1
"I've been taking the course and I'm still on lecture 1, good to hear positive reviews, reinforcing my experience so far! I'll come back and update this when I finish.",1
"I started it a few years ago and went to week 2, but started working solo and never came back to it. 

I never stopped thinking about it, as the lectures are really great and their approach is very refreshing ! I will definitely take it again, back to week 0 :)",1
"I tried attempting Cs50 when I was 14. Man, it was a roller coaster. Some lessons were extremely easy to understand but some were hard for the small mind of a 14 year old. Fast forward, 3 years. I’m attempting it again and am currently on my 7th week :)",1
"13 years old. Long story short, took a programming elective, and now I'm here. My father told me that once I learn to program(specifically python) and learn some sense of web design and development, he’ll hire me (he's an IT director; right below the owner of the company).",1
Dr. Chuck is a legend!,1
"I did my undergrad in Computer Science and I'm finishing up my MS in Computer Engineering. It always drives me nuts when people ask what I do and then assume either is just ""programming"" or ""software engineering"". I try to explain it like this: Computer Science is centered around mathematics(computational science) and problem solving; developing algorithms and optimization. Programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems. Computer Engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems. I always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took Computer/Electrical Engineering as undergrads. Because they, generally speaking, are simply trying to make X thing work, and I am trying to make X thing run as efficient as possible. You can take several different paths to become a coder, but there's very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines. Anyone looking at going to school for Computer Science should understand this. You are learning to be a problem solver first, coding is secondary. Anyone can learn to code. But, being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career. If you go down this path, you are going to be doing far more math than coding, and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code. You will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts, libraries, and frameworks. But, those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use. I hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into.",0
"Wow, what a guest! I was listening to this guy's lectures on Python last year. He has a knack for explaining complex things in a very simple way.",1
"David was my motivation not to give up ever. Not that long ago I was working on a farm and listening his ccna courses. Today I'm managing 6 production servers and complete industrial network infrastructure, and got involved in the software development as c# dev. Only by folowing one rule, that tomorows myself shall be proud of today's myself. Thank you David.",1
"Dr. Chuck's Python course is *literally* how I got started with my career in tech and software engineering/DevOps engineering. It's the same course that I always recommend to people who are looking to get into programming and building a career in tech. Great interview man, really cool to hear you guys sharing your experiences",1
As a Professional Engineer  I really appreciate your direct tech channel no BS David.  It is good to hear Dr. Chuck as I stand firm with him as I also teach tech in my free time while I work in tech full-time.  I hope entry-level folks see this.,1
"I took his courses and he is an amazing teacher 
Nice interview",1
Absolutely love this. I was familiar with Dr. Chuck as an academic and I may have even taken part of his course. I spent 16 yrs teaching programming in a computer science programme and he is 100% right.,1
Hope y'all enjoy the video!,1
Bro.... As a newbie this video is exactly what I needed. There are so many terms to keep up with and you perfectly explained all of the basics. Great video my man!,1
This is hands down the best explanation for programming lingo I have ever heard. I wish somebody would have shown me this in 2014 when I started my mathematics degree. Would have saved me months of frustration down the line. You sir are a saint! Thank you so very much! <3,1
Thank you for the basics. I'm new to the tech field and at first it can all seem overwhelming but it's really not. You helped with that. 👍,1
"More videos like this please!
It was precise, fun and easy to understand!",1
"What an awesome video! Loved how you covered everything, thanks!",1
"Thanks for the video. I learned so much about code and debuging the bugs in the code. I'm taking online classes because of Covid-19 and it's really complicated to apply for one because I'm not tech-savvy, but you sir made it easier to understand, thanks again.",1
"That was great. Where do you recommend we go from here to learn all of the programming terminology like 'iterations' etc. 
Anyone, feel free to recommend a video for me below. Thanks in advance.",1
"one of the Best videos I’ve watched on YouTube. So complete, wasn’t what I was looking for(gotta get more accurate at searching) but I’m subscribing to your content. Because I learned the most watching this video, and took notes! Thank you my good man, wonderful day to you.",1
"Yo bro I just wanted to say thank you, I'm going into CS at Cornell next semester and your videos really motivated me to get to the position I'm in today. I watch all your videos bro much love 🙏",1
"Amazing video, man! Don’t know how this video doesn’t have millions of views, you provided some really useful information here and I appreciate it a ton. I’m getting out of the military soon and trying to navigate this college stuff for the first time and tips like these give me a lot of motivation 🙏🏾",1
"Really important advice, just do what you love. In the end, we all are just humans living in this life.",1
"Hey man, I'm a junior in HS and looking to be a CS manjor in college. I also hope to get into UMD :)",1
One of your best videos hands down,1
This series has made me seriously consider computer science as a possible degree option-Thanks guys/gals of Crashcourse,1
"As a software engineer, I cannot help but be amazed at how you managed to break the information down clearly and logically to it's most important components while still being completely excited and in awe of the stuff you are talking about. My old professors and teachers could seriously learn a thing or two from you!",1
Her enthusiasm while taking about unicode is inspiring.,1
She's awesome! The people behind the animations and editing don't get the recognition they deserve either - really high quality stuff :).,1
I find this so compulsively watchable even though it features math. -John,1
"Programmer here who finds this series seriously interesting. It's also nice to see very informed tutor and friendly way she covers subjects ""in details"". Keep up the good work!",1
"Man, so much love for this series. Never has encoding or Unicode been so exciting!

Also, we cannot stress enough how absolutely REVOLUTIONARY it is for both our operations and the objects of our operations to be encoded basically in the same way. The algorithm that encodes your mp3 AND the encoded file itself are written with ones and zeroes. In a digital context, _nothing_ is really sub-symbolic anymore, everything is written.",1
Thank you so much! I'm 23 years old and FINALLY binary system makes sense to me! So pleased!!! Feels like learning a new language in 10 minutes.,1
My brain hurts and my decision to watch 20 of these at 1am is still not regreted,0
I learned this stuff 10 years ago and this is the first time it was ever presented to me so clearly.,1
Now I know how RAM actually stores bits. Now I can die in peace. Great content.,1
"It completely blows my mind that we can build all of this, much less make it the microscopic size we do.",0
"I am a computer science major, and currently i am learning Assembly Language
my professor is pretty terrible, he doesn't really explain anything,
he just skims over power point slides
but these crash course videos have helped me so much, and made me understand how the CPU, Ram, and the computer works in general, and about the interactions between different components 
i am really thankful for these videos
they also help me understand how my code is interpreted line by line, and executed by the computer

The relationship between Software and Hardware is just really beautiful 
The Humans who came up with the computer, and improved upon it, are really some next level geniuses",1
This episode is ridiculously well-written.,1
"With every episode I've been able to say ""So that's how that works"" at the end of it. Can't wait until next Wednesday.",1
"I seriously cannot get enough of this, this is so cool, thank you so much to CrashCourse, I am blown away by this.",1
This is an absolutely incredible way to teach computing. I love the emphasis on layers of abstraction.,1
Would love to see weighted questions on tests like these.,1
"I am so excited, I am a sophomore in high school and feel in love with computer sciences back in 6th, but now I have finally been able to use my logic skills to make many projects and started building my portfolio. It has been a great trip, and I can't wait until I get better",1
"After 3 years of studying computer science I've realised it's not the right major for me (unrelated to this quiz). Got 3 points btw, maybe I should have taken this quiz 4 years ago 🤣",0
thanks a lot! I had chosen computer science as one of my optional subjects and I got an 8 in this which definitely made me feel more confident about my choice :),1
"Could you make one for physics?(specifically astrophysics or quantum mechanics), I've already decided to have my career in physics, just wanted to see how many other people would want to as well 😁",1
"Programming can be incredibly creative and self-expressive. It's just not taught this way in most colleges unfortunately. Like, it's unlocking the full power of a computer so you can make it do literally whatever you want.

Also, problem solving requires a lot of creativity and lateral thinking generally.",1
"When I took my exams so I can get in a university I really wanted to study architecture or art. However things didn't go well and my score was extremely low so I was left with a few options. One of them was computer science and telecommunications. And tbh despite the fact that I had zero interest in programming before, I freaking love this major so much. Sure it's hard and frustrating af but every day you learn something new and it feels so good when you run your code and it actually works.",1
Andrew Tanenbaum books on CS helped me a lot during uni years and sometimes during discussions at work but they give theoretical knowledge not practical applications,1
"This is so informative, I've been a little on the fence about getting into CS but I love how challenging it is. 
This video really helped answer alot of question I had. I cannot thank you enough.",1
"Hey everyone, 
after some years of experience I know by myself how difficult it can get when learning and optimizing programming skills. 
A few days ago I had a very interessting, nerdy conversation about this topic with a very good friend of mine who is also in the programming business for many years.
The question which fascinated me the most was "" how one could make the lives of programmer a lot easier?""
The reason why i tell you this is because I am very exited about your opinion on this topic!Especially the following 2 questions would interest me the most:
1. As programmer, what are/ were the 2 biggest issues you’re dealing with?
2. Regarding your programming skills, what would you wish for more than anything else?


Thanks so much in advance - looking forward to reading your answers!",1
"Thanks! Great advice! just starting out pursuing a BA CS after being out of school for 20 years!  I have been having a similar dilemma, I originally signed up for software development, but my counselor said I should do CS since I said I want the ability to be hands on, on top of developing.  Not sure if I am thinking too big....... but thanks great video!",1
"To hear that you didn't have any preparation before college makes me feel better for being in the same position. I really didn't have any experience with code, other than html, and felt behind because other student because half of them either smarter or extremely experienced with the area.",1
"Came for computer science.
Stayed for the glorious hair and beard.",1

TSP is a NP hard problem but so is making this video. Every seconds of the video I see an exponential effort invested. Thank you so much!,1
"From the Wikipedia page titled ""Ant colony optimization algorithms"":
""They have an advantage over simulated annealing and genetic algorithm approaches of similar problems when the graph may change dynamically; the ant colony algorithm can be run continuously and adapt to changes in real time. This is of interest in network routing and urban transportation systems.""
This reminds me a lot of the YouTuber ""Pezzza's Work"" his Ants Simulation videos, make sure to watch that! It is analogous to the market, speedrunning, anything really.",1
"Been excited for this video for awhile. I’ve heard of TSP superficially many times.. but never got a deep dive like this before. Very motivated, exceptionally beautiful and naturally narrated. Content like this is the gem of YouTube. 

Just to add: As impossible as this problem is.. it’s wild to know we have a record solution with a tour length of 7.5+ billion.",1
"I'm quite impressed that you managed to avoid mentioning entropy while discussing the annealing approach and the pheromone approach. I once tried to explain pheromone optimization to a friend of mine who wasn't familiar with using entropy to backtrack a search, and I simply wasn't able to explain the process. Well done!",1
"PSPACE problems, common in planning, are arguably ""harder"", as TSP is ""only"" NP-hard.",0
"As a software engineer, I still find this fascinating!",1
"Congrats, Carrie.  You're officially my favorite non-Green-Brothers (hereafter NGB), Crash Course Host. None of the other NGB CC Hosts manage to hold my interest long enough to watch their stuff.   You've got a good mixture of interesting subject matter and a pleasant delivery style.  The GB's are both naturally funny and that works for the.  I feel like the other NGB Hosts try to be too much like the GB's and it comes off false.  For what it's worth.  Keep up the good work.",1
I'm an IT professional. Still is always good to visit the origins of what we are today. :) keep doing this great job!,1
"Absolutely fascinating! I am loving the course this far! The ""bug"" thing really caught me. Can't wait for next week's episode! =D",1
"I'm a computer science student, and this is really entertaining to watch 😁good to research background info on my field",1
That's a fantastic course. It made my transition from mechanical engineer to being a software developer smooth.   Many thanks..,1
This is marvellously well done! Great hosting and editing! :),1
"Yes! Another Crash Course Classic brewing right here! This series is already contending with the Philosophy, Big History, and World History series for me! Keep it up Crash Course! <3",1
"Grace Hopper is awesome in so many ways but not for coining the term ""bug."" Bug, meaning a technical problem, had already been in use for several decades (1800's) so, as Hopper recorded in her journal when she taped in that moth, it was funny to find the ""First actual case of a bug being found."" It was a good joke after a long day at work dealing with problems, basically.",1
"This is for some of you incoming freshman who may be worried about cs if u have never coded before:

I was a freshman data science major last year and I had never written a single line of code. I got a C in my intro to Java course and I was very disappointed as it was something I really want to pursue. I was worried about my performance in the next course Software 1, and if my grade would be lower. I worked on my own projects to better understand the logic and I ended up finishing with an A in the next course, and this was all over the course of one winter break! Now I’m making apps with swiftUI and solving data science machine learning problems in python! And this was all over the course of a year! Don’t be afraid if you struggle early on, it’s a part of the journey.",0
My advice as someone who just graduated with a CS degree and was also a peer tutor is to take the time to do your work and understand the code that you're writing. Too many times I see people slap shit together and then wonder why it doesn't work,0
I’m starting college/uni this year in the Computer Science course!! This was so timely🥺🥰🤩,1
"Another thing I've found helpful as a CS major is to make sure to capitalize on those required gen-ed classes (subjects like History, English, Philosophy, etc.). Having a spare 100-level ""Intro to X"" class in your workload during a tough quarter doing hours upon hours of Java/Python can really defray the pressure. Many of these are also just as good when taken online as well!",1
"Great tips! I would also like to say that understanding logic is very important. My professor really stressed this in my first programming class. He said that he has interviewed graduates who got through their entire college career through trial and error. I think that he is right. Unless you can explain every single piece of your code, line by line, you don't really understand the logic behind it. 

In fact, he makes us go to the lab and the TA asks us to explain our code line by line if we want the full marks on the assignment.",1
"My advice: Get into your school's CS discords and class specific discords (if they have them, or make one if there isn't) . Graduate and undergraduate students work together to give lots of resources for all students and it help a lot. Especially with what proffesors are good and bad, they help with assignments and even answer general questions.",1
"Thanks again for the opportunity! Absolute pleasure working with you guys on this

This 3-hour video is my Entire  2 semester of my Computer Engineering!! such nicely composed Video. Definitely recommend for beginners! Cheers!,1
"I graduated with my BS in Computer Science 16 years ago and, I must say, this video is a good conceptual refresher.",1
"Having been a senior developer for some 15 years now, I still found this a very useful recap and great at articulating certain salient points. Thank you!",1
"This guy taught me C++, Python and now DS.
He's truly amazing.",1
"35 mins in, i am absolutely engrossed & loving the concise breakdown. Much love!",1
"Steven, this video was awesome! You clearly put a lot of preparation into your lessons, and the slide visuals are top notch compared to most other CS educational videos. You definitely earned a subscriber",1
"I failed my precalc class my first semester of college. I did an easier math class the second semester and passed it. I'm ready to try the precalc again. Even though I failed the class, I learned that math is one of the most beautiful languages in the world. Math is great. I'm not good at it by any stretch. I will still conquer this though.",1
"The reason sooo many fear and fail at math is not because it is hard. It is because they treat it like the other basic education subjects. 
Think differently and know that you cannot succeed at math by studying night before, remembering a few equations like dates in history class, nor by just scrapping by. 
Office hours are the key to succeess, yes. But even more important than that, you MUST COMPLETE ALL HOMEWORK WHEN DUE, AND DONT EVER GIVE UP ON A SINGLE PROBLEM. THEN, YOU MUST PRACTICE, PRACTICE! 
Don’t study. Only practice. That way you don’t just know, you have complete UNDERSTANDING ABOUT CONCEPTS. Much like pointing out a particular color in the room, you should practice until you can look at any series of alpha numeric characters and be able to identify what it is asking and instantly knowing (like identifying red + letters S T O P means ""stop!"") how to approach the problem and what equation, formula etc to use. Tools in a toolbox, Baby.",0
"Calculus, Discrete Math, Linear Algebra IS A MUST!!!",1
Lmao just changed my major to CS and was nervous for the math portion. Then I realized I’m not actually that bad at math and I was making it seem worse than it was. Don’t know if that will change when the semester starts but I’m excited! Gotta say thank you Forrest you’re the reason I felt confident in changing my major to Computer Science!,1
"Thanks for the video! Getting into my first math CS courses and it's been challenging, but you're absolutely right. Hard work is what helps you get better at math and understand concepts not memorize formulas.",1
"This is a reall helpful video, thanks considering I want to go into CS. Videos about your process to solving complex problems would be great since I'm doing pure math in school. 🙏",1
Hey Forrest! I'm starting as a freshman in a few weeks and I'm wondering what your thoughts are on pursuing a computer science degree online as apposed to a physical college. Any insight would be greatly appreciated! :),1
I stumbled upon your page a few days ago and I must say it's been the best learning experience in terms narrowing down specific areas to focus on. Excellent content!,1
Kirby this year really is just the gift that keeps on giving,1
"This is really cool! My only gripe is that it’s only 2 player local and not 4, when wireless and online are 4 player(although it’s likely frame rate issues), hopefully they add 4 player local in the future, but other than that the game looks like great fun!",1
"Finally, a game that truly gets me on a spiritual level.",1
"I love that Elfilin already has stuff in this game, Forgotten Land was just before this, so I was really surprised to see the stage, as well as the cosmetics.",1
"I love the part when Kirby is quickly eating the 50 Strawberry Cake. I imagine all this fun stuff from “Kirby’s Epic Yarn” when he couldn’t contain himself from a giant cake. I don’t care either, gotta love that cake!",1
I love how you can add “Dream” in front of any regular object and make it a powerful Kirby artifact.,1
"I've seen art of food-based abilities before, but not traditional abilities in the style of foods. It works unexpectedly well!",1
"Yo! This looks soooooo fun! The variety of modes & cosmetics, competitive & co-op options, etc, & for 15$?!?!?!? YAYUS!!

I also love the attention to detail & references like Master & Crazy hand or the hands in some of the menus at 0:40, 64 Needle Kirby in 1:55, & a Smash Bros reference at 2:54!",1
"This looks pretty fun, only big let down is it seems to only go up to two players in local splitscreen.",1
The pricing is really good here! Great job Nintendo!,1
Sonic can totally pull off more serious stories like in Adventure 2. I'm glad they're taking that approach with Frontiers. I'm optimistic about this one!🤩,1
"It seems like they're actually going for a serious story this time! I hope they manage to pull it off. The cutscenes look so gorgeous and the areas do to. I was pretty sold on playing this game but now I'm really excited! 
(Also this comment is gonna be really dated depending on what the game is like when it comes out. I guess it'll be like my own little time capsule to revisit years later)",1
"Whether or not this Sonic plays out to what we want it to be, we should give thanks to the people that spend many hours developing this game! Looks great 👍",1
I'm loving the cyberspace stages and story so far. Nice to see another island in this trailer too! Can't wait to get this at Christmas. Maybe it'll be one of the few games I've 100%'d,1
"I REALLY REALLY REALLY hope they don't screw this one up. Like, I'd like to actually hear good things about a mainline 3D sonic game made by sonic team that's actually good.",1
"Beautiful, finally a new sonic game that does justice for the original series, the first showcase was strange, but this one is definitely better compared to the old one",1
"I can't understand why some areas look genuinely breathtaking, then others are just floating disjoined rails and walls. I don't understand how there's such a massive difference!",0
I always love when sonic is more serious instead of cracking jokes hopefully he takes things seriously in this game.,1
"So… this actually looks good. As long as Egghead doesn’t come back as another villain pulling the strings, looks promising.",1
"Finally, a trailer that makes Sonic Frontiers look exciting!",1
"The 3DS is probably my favorite system of all time. With access to all DS games and the impressive digital library, almost no other system library can compare. The library isn’t only large, it’s diverse. There are bangers for every genre of game. All of this is a portable package.",1
"I recently started playing Kid Icarus Uprising and, apart from needing to take a few breaks to rest my hands, I am shocked with how much fun I'm having with it and I'm bummed that there hasn't been a sequel made since then.",1
"Love the 3DS!

Planet Robobot's true arena is one of the most satisfying challenges to overcome across all games. Would be #1 on my personal list.

Great memories of playing Smash Run w friends while getting lunch or wutever else.",1
"Fire Emblem became one of Nintendo’s larger series thanks to the 3DS. I don’t really play Fates or SoV anymore but I still find myself revisiting Awakening, love that game. If you can step outside of your completionist mindset you’d probably love it",1
"I was surprised Kid Icarus: Uprising isn't on here. I think it's the best 3DS game. It's a true masterpiece. Yet again, Sakurai developed this game too, and a lot of his games are gold. He's a very hard worker and has high expectations for his games.",1
"3DS just felt so special. I didn't expect it but found myself really into Pokémon Sun and Moon. I think Pokémon Refresh was a huge addition to making me attached to my team, and I found myself tearing up in a lst battle when my Mismagus held on to the end for me. I know it ruins the game for some people (the Pokémon holding on has a higher rate of stopping KO than the focus band, apparently but don't quote me on that) but for me it was JUST want i wanted as a jaded almost-30 year old who really just wanted to enjoy the game.",1
Smash on 3DS was a marvel in it's own right. The fact the 3DS could handle it AND at 60FPS on the OG 3DS was absolutely mind blowing to me for the time,1
"My favorite series is the Dillon’s Rolling Western series. I remember going on the eshop to find The Last Ranger being advertised. However, I wouldn’t get it until I grew up a bit more. Dillon’s character stood out when I am already attracted to stylized games. 
All three of the games are tower defense where you are trying to clear waves as fast as possible. Currently all of the games are exclusive to the eshop. Unless you live in a PAL region, those games will be lost to time.",1
"Kid Icarus Uprising is my favourite game of all time. The combat is fun, the weapons are cool, the characters are funny and layered, and the story and world building is fantastic.  It's been half the time there was between the last two games in the series, but I will gladly wait another 10 years to get more Kid Icarus goodness",1
"I know this will get overlooked, but I really wanna give props to the announcer, she did a fantastic job and put so much energy into the announcement, it honestly made me pretty hyped",1
"I love how the splatoon colour themes are based on complimentary colours (opposite colours), for example…

Splatoon 1 - orange and blue
Splatoon 2 - pink a green
Splatoon 3 - yellow and purple

Some of the colours are slight variations such as pink, it’s meant to be red but pinks a good substitute",1
I’ll always love splatoon. They never take away things that people have always liked and instead they either make it better or add on things we’ve wanted. I’m just really obsessed because I’ve always loved this game since I was little :),1
"whoever this announcer was definitely needs a raise. everything was so easily digestible, and i’m glad new players can find their way even easier! she sounded so energetic, intrigued, and passionate overall. this 30 minute direct was beautifully executed!",1
"I'm going to miss the idols from Splatoon 2, they slayed, perfect character design, and wonderful personalities! I didn't expect we would get three idols, Big man, Shiver and Frye! They seem to have a lot of potential, I'm looking forward to doing story mode too! The gameplay must be amazing!",1
"I was genuinely afraid, I thought the game would be identical to the second, or even worse!  But this Direct definitely made me change my mind!  There are crazy news, the setting is much more oriental than that of previous games, and I love it.  New weapons, story mode that feels spatial, practically a free choice of character customization of much more!  I have no negative comments, the only flaw could be a short duration of the Story mode, which for lone players like me could be a problem, but I sincerely hope I'm wrong! 🐙",1
The expressions of the characters are perfect and everything looks so lively like the inklings have actually remade civilisation but no humans. Nintendo doesn't just cease to be awful. They don't know how to!,1
"The announcer here and on the direct is so good. She sounds so energetic and passionate and it fits the game really well and gets me excited to play even more.

I am so unbelievably hyped up for this game omg

I’ve been a fan of Splatoon one but I didn’t get a hold of the game until Splatoon 2 cause I was poor lol
I legit can’t wait to play this every day.",1
"I’m definitely interested to see harvestella shown off. The concept sounds really cool, but the trailer left me with very little idea as to how it would actually work, so I’m interested to see more",1
Wanted to wish everyone a Happy Wednesday today & love watching your video game news everyday Jon keep up the great Work! 👍,1
I am actually kind of looking forward to harvestella... its a very pretty game.,1
"The fact that the version of RE7 that came out was considered ""marketing's worst nightmare"" shows you that listening to marketing people is a foolish idea when it comes to creative endeavours.",0
Gamescon had quite a few games that peaked my interests but that sony edge controller was the most intriguing. Looks like we can hot swap joysticks which could be a fix to combat drift.,1
Whenever I see a company announce a release date I never take it seriously anymore and almost expect there to be a delay,0
As term of gamescom I was excited for Gotham Knights villain trailer and the release moving up to October 21st I'm still getting day 1. I'm excited for Castillo protocol I'm excited for sonic frontiers finally getting a release date in November. And I loved the new trailer of Hogwarts legacy,1
Thank you for adding chapters to your Directs :),1
"This direct genuinely felt like a love letter to the older gamers that's been waiting 5-20 years for these ports of Megaman Battle Network, Persona, Nier, etc.",1
I will never underestimate a Nintendo Direct Mini Partner Showcase ever again.,1
"This was far beyond my expectations. It was so surprising and joyful for me to see all Major Persona Games being ported on Nintendo Switch & also some New footage from SONIC FRONTIERS. I'll Never underestimate a Partner Showcase Direct Again, it was best of them all until now.",1
"This was actually a pretty good direct.

Good job nintendo! You surpised me!",1
"I am HIGHLY interested in the Megaman collection. Some of my favorite GBA games ever. 
Return to Monkey Island could be interesting and just hearing the music is really nice. I like the style but it's a pretty big change from what I'm used to seeing.
Kenta looks really charming and adorable. I adore the concept.
Dragon Quest Treasure seems like a real blast. I love being able to fight alongside companions. It makes me miss Dragon Quest Monster: Joker.
There's a lot of promise coming up but. Nintendo please. It was a huge 3DS hit. Please remaster or remake Tomodachi Life!",1
Nintendo just put out a better Sonic trailer than Sega did. This should have been the first trailer for the game. It makes so much more sense than the weird rollout Sega did,1
"This might be in the running for the best direct ever. So little downtime, each announcement was ranging from cool and not my thing, to wow",1
"THANK YOU FOR FINALLY PUTTING PERSONA 5 ON THE SWITCH, I HAVE BEEN WAITING",1
"I do quite like how the splatana feels like a samurai, stealth based ninja weapon. Diversifies the gameplay quite a bit.",1
"Well-worded and gracefully honest! It does like quite the quality title- I'm excited as a hardcore Splatoon fan. I have 670 hours on 2, so small changes still do mean a lot to me after playing the second game for the past 5 years.

Of course, it doesn't hurt to want just a little bit more for a sequel. I'm hoping that future additions to the game will help it to become even better.",1
"The graphics actually look a lot smoother, more intricate and more polished, as well as the frame rate and overall flow of movement, which is super nice. I wasn't expecting a graphical improvement after the first footage we saw, but now I'm happy.",1
"I wasn't really expecting any new formula for the Single Player & Im completely fine with the stuff you mentioned. Maybe they'll explore new things in the paid DLC

From the trailers I've seen & your gameplay, you get shot onto the stage for Turf Wars & Anarchy Battles thus getting rid of team specific spawn areas. Perhaps that's what made the maps feel bigger? Can't wait to see how they update the Splatoon/Splatoon 2 stages",1
"I guess in terms of a single player mode for Splatoon 3 I was hoping for a Bowser's Fury type of world where it feels more grand, some exploration and seemless transitions into the ""levels"".",1
"I feel like the biggest sell for Splatoon 3 is the timing. With the switch being as old as it is now, most people have a switch in their home. So for kids this is a big buy, especially if you haven't played it yet, but all your friends are playing it. I haven't played in a few years and I'm really excited. Just to chill, enjoy all it has to offer along with the community surrounding it. It's a lot easier to sell this game to a Japanese audience as well because of all the marketing and promotional events after the game comes out. As well as the IRL concerts with their in game idols.",1
I honestly hope it's great considering that Splatoon is my  personal 2nd favorite Nintendo franchise behind Mario,1
I am LIVING for the revolutionary joke. Gonna be giggling about that for a while. Great breakdown and honest feedback!,1
"This looks much better than the first wave, waluigis pinball and mushroom gorge make the whole expansion worth it.",1
"I remember trying to pass the first pinball in Waluigi Pinball as a young kid. The feeling of accomplishment you got from beating it too the ramp where it falls was great. Definitely one of my favorite tracks. The pinball machine segment, the most chaotic place in any track that gets more chaotic every lap which may be why it’s so popular.",1
"I’m literally hyped for this wave, they have Waluigi’s Pinball! I do find it interesting that they are also creating completely new tracks as well ( like the sundae one), as most people suspected complete remakes of the originals. All in all, I’m excited",1
"I can't watch this without a huge smile on my face! Wave 2 looks incredible!

I still can't believe Nintendo is bringing back 48 courses spanning the entire Mario Kart series and updating them for MK8DX. It's like a dream. So many great memories with the originals! ❤",1
1:16 My favorite course from Mario Kart DS. Can't wait to race on it this Thursday 🙂,1
Looks amazing.  Waluigi Pinball had some Electrodrome thrown in,1
"This wave looks amazing, Im amped to play these and relive the past once again! I hope they bring Koopa Cape and Peach Gardens along the future waves. Those 2 tracks especially are my favorite tracks to run!~",1
"These courses have made an already 5 star game even better.  It’s great they’re including one all-new course per wave too.   

I’d love to see some new battle courses at some point though…",1
Vou comprar o meu Nintendo switch esse ano! Esse canal tem me ajudado e me animando cada dia mais 💕,1
"Tenho  certeza que esse switch vai ficar bonito, adoro vídeo de modificação do switch, Coelho🤩 😁😄 # nintendista sem Nintendo switch 😅",1
Ficou muito bonito o switch! Agora é hora de ver o vídeo do melhor casal Nintendista! :),1
"Tô esperando lançar o switch oled nacional pra eu comprar ele ❤️ não vejo a horaaaaa, quero muito jogar",1
"I'm honestly super excited for this game to come out. The new Fusion mechanic looks crazy, the story looks engaging, it just looks like a very fun time. Here's hoping the game thrives

(Edit: Apparently auto correct likes strives better than thrives)",1
"This looks insanely good, and the battle system with all its complexities makes me go tingly all over. I spend so many hours learning all the different blades and how to utilize them in battle in Xeno 2, can’t wait to get my hands on this new system, it looks super interesting.",1
What I love about the Xenoblade series is their integration of their battle mechanics and story line. It hits different.,1
This game looked really good. I’m a non Xenoblade fan and checked out this direct and I gotta say it genuinely got me interested in the series. I’ll definitely check this out if I can buy this game,1
"This looks amazing it's my most anticipated game of the year. xenoblade 2 was such a masterpiece and I can't wait for the next chapter the new battle mechanics look so sick and their is so much variety.

Edit: was expecting a typical nopon voice didn't expect Riku to sound like such a Chad 🤣",1
I feel like this is Nintendo's version of the final fantasy series. I hope the Xenoblade Chronicles continues to expand. This will surely keep me busy for a long time,1
"I'll never get tired of watching this masterpiece direct !! The game has so much content, plus the interlink mechanic is just INSANE! They definitely incorporated a truly amazing mechanic after the Driver/Blade one in XC2, Monolith truly never dissapoints!!!",1
"This really feels like a perfect blend between all three previous xenoblade games, in terms of gameplay, art-style, and world features. I'm starting to really feel it!",1
This looks like the most complex battle system I have ever seen. Layer after layer of options. I am giddy after each function shown. i cant wait to play this. I will have to buy it and play.,1
I think xenoblade might be becoming the best JRPG franchise and this game might cement that.,1
C’est trop bien j’ai vraiment hâte que je jeux sortent et de vous voir en vidéos dessus 🤩🤩🤩,1
Vous êtes vraiment trop chanceux d’avoir plus de tester en avance🤩🥰,1
"Le jeu avec le quelle je vous ai découvert, Franchement j'ai envie de pleurer continuer comme ça les GOAT ! 😄💪🔥🔥",1
"Trop bien 😍😍 SPL 3 !! Franchement j'ai trop hâte de voir votre let's play et tout 🥰  comme pour SPL 1 et SPL 2 ^^ 
en tout cas vous êtes les BEST 😘 road to 2 millions 💜",1
"Ahhh c’est trop cool, vite que le jeu sorte 🔥🔥",1
Excellent excellent votre vidéo j’adore c’est du beau travail merci de nous faire découvrir ce jeu,1
Well I'm SURE This will end up well. lol,1
"I hope one day people understand, Gabe Newell once said "" The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It's by giving those people a service that's better than what they're receiving from the pirates."" truer words are yet to be spoken amidst this industry.",1
"Questions:
Does the DRM appy to anything played on the Switch or just some upcoming titles? Do I need an internet connection to play on the Switch? Im always connected, so I had no idea this might be the case. Will DRM make the switch unusable in another console generation or two?",0
"This is part of why I stick with the older consoles. All these servers, network logins, and DRM stuff just ruins gaming for me. I just like popping the game in and playing.",0
"It will probably not be an ""online check"" DRM. I saw a flash of a website in the video on emulation piracy DRM. Denuvo probably thinks that they have a way for a game to be able to run a check to see if it's running in an emulated environment. Based on their history using kernel-mode DRM / anti-cheat BS on the PC I would avoid any switch game running anything from denuvo.",0
The thing with drm like denuvo is that it literally pushed piracy more. I've had a couple of friends with RE: 8 on PC that literally got the pirated version downloaded just cause it performs 100x better. And for me personally. I bought the ultimate version of dying light 2. I really enjoyed it but i had to lower settings cause I thought my PC couldn't handle it or something but then I tried out the cracked version and then all of a sudden the game runs like butter. I hate denuvo and if used frequently on switch. It will ruin games and even trust from the fanbases.,0
"It's also worth noting that the primary assumption behind DRM is that people that would pirate a game if there's no DRM would legally buy the game if there's DRM.  That's a really absurd assumption.  Most people that are actually doing the pirating would otherwise not buy the game at all, so their piracy has a net zero impact on the developer.

And DRM gets cracked in only a few months, so the pirates need only wait anyway.

DRM does only one thing, and that's punish the people that legally buy the game.",0
The eff is what I said immediately. Denuvo does not stop piracy! It kills game performance.,0
That's exactly what switch games need. Something to hinder the performance and bog stuff down. Brilliant.,0
"Man, every year that passes I'm feeling more and more vindicated in emulation and archiving.",1
with the amount of people obsessed with nostalgia these days no one will actually be nostalgic in a few years,0
Pikmin 3 1+2 are already nostalgic just waiting for 4 to come out and 3 to become nostalgic,1
I agree about Splatoon 2 being nostalgic even though I've only been playing since March 2022. When u beat the game it feels so good too hear fresh start by the squid sisters,1
BOTW is also gonna be nostalgic 💖,1
the hype around Super Smash Bros ultimate is something I will never forget it,1
The game I’m already nostalgic for is botw hearing the theme and watching the trailer just gives me chills,1
Nostalgia is a very personal thing. That being said; I don't ever see myself being nostalgic for nintendo switch sports,0
Here’s our revisit review of Lego Star Wars with patch 1.0.7 - hopefully this helps anyone looking for latest information on the Nintendo Switch version through our All Patched Up format! Mark,1
"The fact that you revisit some patched games is one of the things I love most about your channel.  While I’ll say that many games should not release in the poor state that they do, such is the state of the gaming world in 2022.  You guys do all of a wonderful service by updating your reviews when possible.  Thank you!",1
It’s easy to be harsh on the Switch and the way some ports perform but it’s amazing to have full games like this on the move. When developers get it right it really sings,1
This is why I love this channel they don’t just abandon games at a review,1
"I suppose it's because I grew up when all video games had pop in so it doesn't really create a negative connotation for me with a game.  I know that if a game isn't wholly designed for the Switch that issues can occur with frame rates, pacing and the like but it is always nice to see when developers continue to work on and iron out the problems with their games. I think the patch was needed and accomplished what it was supposed to.",1
"A note for your souldiers revisit, while the patch fixed a lot of the worst issues, the fire temple, a late game area, is still prone to a lot of  crashing when saving at dragon swords, it was 50/50 every time I saved in that dungeon whether it would crash or not, didn't get any crashes anywhere else so I'm not sure why that area specifically is so problematic (it was also an area where one room in particular had a game breaking performance bug before the big patch)",0
I preordered this and I didn’t really notice much of the original issues but I think that’s because I was just enjoying the gameplay and I was mainly playing handheld on an OLED but it’s always good to see developers going back and fixing things to improve the game,1
"Glad the performance has gotten better on split screen. I stomached it the first time through, but might return to mess around! Knew this game had potential on the switch",1
"There’s so many things that annoyed me about this game and I ended up quitting well before completion. I really like games with tight, responsive controls, where you can learn techniques to have complete mastery over your character’s move set. This game was like the opposite to that 😕",0
"I nearly got 100% completion with this game. Had to stop after more than a couple of side quests had a weird performance issue where it would stutter beyond belief. It took a lot of patience, but if you could finish the quest the stuttering stopped. It was frustrating. Usually they were quests where you had to find things that were all around a planet, so you had to traverse large areas. Trying to do so when every input took several seconds to respond was too much for me. 

Now I'm stuck on some backlog games, so I don't know if I'll ever have 100% completion. But maybe one day....",0
"i'm so glad that the direction they're going with when it comes to ""chaos"" is pure expression and a sense of warmth, rather than falling into the trap of being edgy",1
"It almost sounds like a blend of Indian, Japanese, and Brazilian culture, which really brings out the idea of diverse unity and expressionism that chaos is all about. I love it!",1
"I absolutely love how Chaos is used. Instead of being like an apocalypse or something, the chaos is presented as a huge jumble of culture. Love it.",1
"Whoever mixed this song is a genius. They managed to fit so many cultures in such a small amount of time, and managed to perfectly make fake squid language sound great, all whilst making a genuinely slapping song",1
"don’t get me wrong, the concert vibe from the other games was cool, but this fees like a whole festival and its really refreshing!",1
"shiver’s part sounds like traditional japanese songs, big man’s part sounds like a bit of brazilian funk maybe, frye’s part sounds like it’s traditional from middle eastern, and the chorus sounds like samba. i’m in love with this song",1
"I love the music, but another thing I noticed is how different every idol’s dance was. They had their own unique way of dancing according to their culture and it makes me so happy to see a mashup of multiple cultures in one performance.",1
The only bad thing about this song is that it ends.,0
"Not sure if anyone else had noticed this, but when I rewatched this again, I saw that the platforms that Shiver, Frye, and Big Man were standing on actually connect together. The bottom part makes up a fish. Shiver’s platform is the head, Big Man’s the middle part, and Frye is the tail. Very subtle detail, I love it!",1
"I love all the other idol songs, but I gotta say: this song is the one that feels the most like a CELEBRATION. It has a cultural festival quality to it",1
"Malheureusement c'est toujours les mêmes promos et les mêmes prix, c'est soulant a la longue, sur le ps store les prix sont gonfler pour faire croire a un eventuel ""promo"" 😒😒😒il y a 1 mois metro exodus gold edition a 9'99 euro et la le jeu seul a 10,49euros😒😒😒",0
On parle trop de Sony et peut de Microsoft 😥,0
Ac odyssey un des meilleur assassin’s creed 😓,0
Now to get ready for Gamescom!,1
I'm way more excited to see Harvestella than I am for Splatoon 3. So I'm happy they're going to show it off.,1
Very excited for PSVR2. Gonna feel like that big leap in graphics that flat games don't really have anymore because of diminishing returns,1
I actually like that you keep it real and don’t scream and shout. It’s gets a bit scripted and I feel some people do it for the younger audience. Which is like the equivalent of offering them candy to get in a van.,1
"*46:16*
*Let’s just appreciate how they always manage to put a smile on our faces whenever we feel negative!*
😃",1
"Honestly the design is pretty nice looking, and damn that controller looks so sleek. Love the white on the console and controller too.",1
i like the lights under the joycon control sticks. that's what stood out to me the most. it really is a nice looking console.,1
"This convinced me that the switch pro controller needs an all white version, because that controller looks so nice!",1
"The biggest advantage the Aya Air has over the steam deck, is the steam deck isn't available in all countries and regions to buy, and this should be, so people have the option to get this.",1
"Hmm... I'd still go with the Steam Deck. This is more expensive and looks like it performs worse. The only thing going for it is the OLED screen. Plus I think the Steam Deck will last longer, with it's powerful hardware and Valve's continued support. 
Plus I'm not sure how to feel about Aya Neo. They release a new console every 6 months, which makes me question their dedication to support in the long run. And they were WAY too expensive, and probably only brought the price down on this new one because of the Steam Deck.
Edit: Should probably finish watching the video before writing a comment because you said pretty much everything I said haha.",0
It's always a good day when a new Beatemups video is published,1
"I’m in the same boat, i EXCLUSIVELY play portably now. So much so that i don’t touch my ps4 anymore, i’m entirely on the switch. I dreamt of having the yakuza series being portable and working well… but with options like the aya neo & steam deck i can have that! Love this new generation of portable gaming, it’s INSANE!",1
"Wood! Thanks for reviewing this and introducing me to a new controller (I know you were mainly focusing on the mini streamdeck, but still)! I had never heard of it and I was looking for something like that because believe it or not, my pro controller/joycons all HAVE STICK DRIFT, so finding a controller that addresses that problem is exactly what I needed especially when it's got gyroscope capabilities too! (I play splatoon, so I need gyro and sticks with no drift of course.)",1
"Honestly, that tricolour, three team mode was what sold the game to me. It's just a shame that it's limited to Splatfests only. I felt like as a mode, that was the truly unique and franchise-pushing idea of a mode that warranted a whole sequel. Oh well, I guess Nintendo's servers wouldn't be able to handle it...

At the moment, this is just what Splatoon 2 should have been back in 2017, to me. Splatoon really needs to evolve beyond the first game in quite tremendous or advanced ways in order to actually feel like a true sequel (the tricolour mode was close to that principle, but alas, it's only limited to Splatfests) - otherwise ""Stay Fresh!"" is just a quote of sheer irony because Splatoon has, thus far to me, not proven to stay fresh.",0
"The locker feature, the ghost feature and everything else looks so exciting! Can’t wait for this game!",1
"A lot of folks were hoping for an apartment they could decorate, and I feel like the locker feature is a good way to address that without distracting too much from the main game.",1
THANK GOD we can finally just queue up with friends on the same team. That was the main thing keeping my friends and I from playing more.,1
"So many quality of life upgrades, gameplay upgrades, and things the fanbase has been asking for have now been included. This game truly is set apart from splat 2. Thank you so much Nintendo and Splat3 dev team. You all did amazing 🤩",1
The replay feature is actually pretty fire,1
"I already know I’m gonna pull something from dancing to these new songs. Cant wait to play against everyone as team rock!! Amazing job, Nintendo!!",1
"This game is looking fresher than grocery store produce. I love the new  aesthetic and weapons. Plus the new features look really fun. I also love how you can customize your character with emotes and lockers, it fits perfectly with splatoon",1
I just watch unboxing vids to get that mental high of experiencing something new without actually splurging for it.,1
"I remember being so giddy and excited for this thing to come out. Watching videos, unboxings, gameplay, etc. Seeing this video again brings back some really great memories.",1
"This is amazing
No confusing instructions 
No details missed
(Except the one we're how you take the little controls off)
And the cool thing is that you didn't stutter
It doesn't matter but it's just amazing how your explanation went",1
"I own a PS4 but i suddenly have the urge for one of this.

The red and blue design looks great.",1
"My brothers have one of each of these and I use them sometimes, the only problem we've run into with them is the joycons bugging out with the display. He has had to send them in twice for that and they still get that problem, but other than that it's a great system for us.",1
"Very clear and thorough, thank you !",1
"Hey, just wanted to let u know what an amazing job u did explaining everything this helped me a lot.",1
"Coucou :) J'adore tes vidéos, je te suivais au début par rapport à mes enfants.
Maintenant je me suis mise à jouer (à Splatoon avec ma fille !) et comme toi (car j'adore l'univers HP) j'attends ardemment que le jeu soit sorti !
Je crains néanmoins la sortie sur switch, peur que cette version sois moins jolie. Je vais me tourner vers la version PC je crois. 
Bonne journée :)",1
Merci Edouard pour ces précisions très précises :) Du coup je pourrais le préco demain sur ma Xbox Série S ? Merci de ta réponse (Nayko),1
"Merci pour TOUTES ces informations, très riches 👍",1
F for Mr. Satoru Iwata. Thank you. May your soul Rest In Peace.,1
This F is for respect not only to a great man but to the man who made a ton of Nintendo games possible R.I.P,1
R.I.P Mr. Satoru Iwata for such a amazing console,1
"You did a great job , just got mine oled version and it was amazing . F for Mr.Sotaru Iwata Rest Well Legend ❤️",1
Just got my OLED Model over two weeks and i personally like mines a ton been taking good care of it best gaming console I've own to date. PS: F for Mr Satoru Iwata!,1
"RIP Iwata, I was so sad when he died, he was the face of nintendo. What a loss, but his ideas gave the greatest success to the company and helped them move forward.",1
"Dark mode was the first thing i check in the settings lol 😂
Everything is dark mode for me if it is possible lol",1
"Rip iwata, a legend, never forgotten",1
"Rip Iwata, a true legend ❤️",1
Still happy with my original at the minute. I can't compensate paying for the upgrade personally. But fully understand why you would go for it as a first time switch buyer,1
It's a bit expensive and I didn't want to buy it as I have the original but my husband bought it for me as an early Christmas present and I was able to transfer and re download my stuff. Overall I'm really happy with the Oled version. It feels more sturdy and the graphics are much better. I was able to sell my original switch so we got quite a bit of our money back so I say it's definitely worth it 🤗,1
It looks neat! The screen looks slightly bigger and it looks like a quick cash grab if u have the original Switch and the Switch Lite. I love playing the Switch on table top mode with the Switch Pro controller! It feels more comfortable and it gives u that lil home console feel!,1
"THANK YOU. You just gave a good review unlike the stereotypical reviews that only bring up the ""its just a larger screen and that's it"" reviews that are bandwaggoning trash. So, thanks very much for this, you brought up a few things I didn't yet know about it! ☺",1
"Picked up on OLED and very happy with the bigger screen size. Paired with my Hori Split Pro joycons, its feels great...the stock joycons feel small and uncomfy. The screen for my old Switch looks like an old cheap tablet now with that huge bezel. If you have no fingernails, the cart door is way harder to open than the old Switch door.",1
"I have the V2 but I do think the OLED is nice. I like how it has ethernet support,and I hear it has a padded dock now which they should of done from the beginning but oh well. I play only on my TV so I won’t be upgrading until a whole new system drops but I give the OLED a 9/10,def worth it for new switch buyers imo.",1
"The card slot is way harder to open on the oled, sucks for people like me with short fingernails. Never had this issue with the original so it's baffling as to why they changed it.",0
Love my OLED. Such a premium experience compared to the original.,1
"If Nintendo makes another Switch, I really hope they make the Joy-cons bigger and more ergonomic.",1
These presents are really what all people need and love!!! Thank you so much!!!,1
My man TOBY FOX did the unimaginable yet again I can't believe he made the music for the raid battle LET'S GOOO! 17:20,1
"Some cool improvements here, though I still think the gem forms are a little silly. Would love to just get mega evolution back, those were awesome",1
"This game seems to have a lot going for it, three storylines sounds like great idea (at least on paper) as it would give both fans that want a more traditional pokemon game and those who want something fresh.",1
Onix better be in Scarlet/Violet……the dream of having a Crystal Onix must come true.,1
"I feel like the hill to climb after Arceus is huge, I really liked the independence aspect of the game, the catching mechanics that didn't require you to battle, and no forced encounter in tall grass, which allowed you to see the wild Pokémon. These new games seem to have kept some of these, so I'm eager to find out how it will pan out.",1
"*1997* : Legendary Pokemon are elusive to find, and even more difficult to catch. Usually only obtainable after finishing the main game. Non-stop rumours about dubious methods for how to obtain them (underneath trucks etc)
*2022* : VVVVRRROOOOMMMMM!!!",0
The new Terastal gimmick looks awesome,1
I’m just happy that Gogoat is finally in another game. Such an under appreciated Pokémon.,1
"Let's not deny this, guys: Despite the Wii U being a huge commercial failure, it had a great library of games. It's a huge shame the console itself didn't do very well.",0
"Despite its terrible sales, the Wii U made up a huge part of my childhood and I loved it",1
"Brings back so many memories of my early childhood to now.  I remember when I was very little, I had the N64 where I first played MARIOKART.  Then I was later given as a present the Game Boy.  And then I remember later on I wanted the GameCube which I got I think either for my birthday or for Christmas.  And that’s where I first played Animal Crossing.  I played the other versions on the other systems as well.  I then asked about a year or two later Santa for a blue DS Lite, and a few years later I got the DS i XL which was a surprise present from my grandma.  And when I graduated from middle school, my grandma got me the Wii as a graduation present.  I eventually also got the 2DS only because it was slightly cheaper and now I have the Nintendo Switch.  I still love them all and Nintendo to this day!  Animal Crossing, Super Mario Bros., MARIOKART, MARIO PARTY, and all the other classics are still my favorite to this day.  And I can’t wait to see Super Nintendo World when it opens at Universal Studios!",1
Thank you Nintendo for making our childhood memorable. I once owned GB Color and Nintendo DS and I had so much fun back in those days.,1
"Thank you for this video. Now whenever Nintendo talks about how much of a family friendly company they are - similar to what Sakurai said when he was introducing Terry Bogard for Smash, I'm going to remind them that they once were a love hotel.",1
Glad Nintendo is still fighting in the console bussiness despite their ups and downs over the years! The gaming world is benefited so much with Nintendo in than without.,1
This is probably my favorite game company thank you for making this.,1
"Considering the games releasing for other major Consoles, It's Amazing how Nintento still holding it's possition as one of the big 3.",1
What does take time to appreciate how much Nintendo put into the conslas and still makes it family friendly,1
"Fun fact:The success of Nintendo switch can be attributed to several factors that have come together in favor of the console.
Its hybrid capabilities allow it to appeal to a wide customer base, and it receives plenty of support from both first party and third party developers.",1
Loved the first two and looking forward to the third. A nice alternative to the FPS shooters out there.,1
"Just have to say this is the best “primer” I’ve seen for this game. Fantastic “coverage”, Tom :)",1
"i love the idea of just shooting paint in the scenery,
that alone was enough for me to love the franchise,
i'm glad we already have a third game!",1
"It looks really good imo. That's what i love about Nintendo, it's always colourful and incredibly fun to play. Sometimes that's all you need, colours in your life.",1
I recommend using gyroscope. It is the best option to take advantage in this game.,1
"I’m looking forward to this one. Thanks for your analysis, though admittedly I don’t get too tripped up by graphics and performance unless it’s abysmal.",1
Splatoon is a lot of fun to jump in and play some games. 3 will be the first i play from its release. Excited.,1
Definitely excited for this all the specs aside. It’s gonna be a lot of fun!,1
"I seem to recall Splatoon 2 being a dynamic 900p, so it’s nice to see they were able to optimize the game enough to finally make it up to 1080p",1
The OLED screen is so incredible compared to the original. My flatmate bought one and I can’t look at it without sheer eNvY,1
"Watching an adult get so excited about video games is my favorite thing ever. Literally can’t stop smiling, thank you for that ! ❤️",1
The screen is noticeably better so it definitely improves the on the go experience.,1
"Haven’t watched this channel in a while, and it’s honestly refreshing to see this level of excitement on YouTube. 👍
Makes me feel giddy (Which I haven’t felt in over 10 years)",1
Managed to create a better demo/review than even Nintendo could hope to do with the commercials. Incredible!,1
The oled model definitely looks cool. I'd love to try it out one day.,1
The OLED screen is truly amazing and the games look way more detailed,1
I was curious as to when you'd be able to do this unboxing. We all knew you were getting one but never knew when you'd reveal it. Well worth the wait! 🤩😁,1
"Watching this again because my friends got me hooked on video games. And after watching animal crossing and Pokémon streams I kinda have been researching which switch would be better for my technology availability. 
Now I think I definitely should save up for this one. I like bigger screen option and newer version. Can’t wait to see it available on local stores as I just discovered I could possibly even get it on my mobile carrier contract for less than my iPhone 12. 
Also I see this as good option when you don’t have smart tv to play games on (like my friends) and I even looked up possible laptop connections. So this one looks right up to my alley. Also for when I’m willing to give my phone a break or just feel like playing video games (which is something I’ve only been discovering few weeks ago)",1
I actually love every single video that you do…I love seeing the joy and legit happiness that you show,1
"Two Broken Nintendo Switches in one video, that HAS to be a record... What's the WEIRDEST Amazon Product you've ever found??

"I'm not gonna lie - the part where you just documented your experiences with real people fixing the joycon is so refreshing and I loved this part of the video. Please take us shopping or something lol. I know we're like in a pandemic, but if there's an opportunity to do it safely, please take it :)",1
I love how friendly and cheerful was that Retro employee haha,1
I just love how unexpected everything is going. Better than any Netflix series.,1
"retro madness doesn't have much in terms of games, but i will definitely keep an eye on them. it's easy to get retro games here in japan, but, obviously, they're in japanese. i've noticed how hard it it to find a used game store like this on the states, so this is a great find especially since they sell online. thank you.",1
"Finding controllers dead randomly happens to me to those batter packs would actually be pretty nice, especially if they’re reminiscent of wii motes",1
"Subscribe and I might give you custom switches, phones, ipads, cars, or even a house!

"yo I remember when we did that with iPads last year, that was such a fun challenge!! 👀🔥",1
"I love the end where he pays the mom a lot if money, she looked so happy.",1
I love how he gives away money and customized electronics to people in need and I fully support that❤️,1
This man inspired me to work hard on art and I achieved it,1
binge-watching here. you guys are amaaaaziiing!!!!,1
Your videos are amazing my man ❤️,1
It’s so kind of him! He does what he enjoys but he also give them away! Thank you Zach !,1
your just awesome there's just no other way to describe you.Your truly amazing keep up the good work.,1
I just realized that in every video when zhc works by himself he wins all the time,1
"""When I was a kid, I used to think you were cool.""

When he was a kid, you could bludgeon 12 people to death with each individual peice of first party hardware and it'd still work fucking flawlessly. Consoles, handhelds, controllers, carts. That shit was made of nokium. It did not break. The number of times I threw a controller. Playstation, you could only throw that once. They were always the most sensitive. Xbox, until the xbox one, you could abuse that shit for five, ten years and still see it work when you weren't seeing red rings.

Nintendo? Literally murder people with their gear, it did not give a FUCK.",0
"Apparently, it's because they're cheaply made. The parts in the joysticks are apparently fairly fragile, and the buttons are suboptimal. Shoulder buttons are reported to give out because of poor soldering and lack of reinforcements. There's also an issue with wiring, as the (+) button and the R button are wired together, while the opposite joycon is wired regularly. 

In other words, the joycons, while the optimal method to play the Switch in its entirety, are poorly designed for their tasks.",0
"Iwata and Reggie were the souls of Nintendo, they embodied why every Nintendo fan loved Nintendo (myself included) every other gaming platform at the time just felt like they were shoving shit down your throat, but when Nintendo was showing off stuff it was like they were popping into your living room to show you the stuff they’ve been working on and were so proud of it, but when they left, all that soul of the company left with them, I’ll always be a Nintendo fan, but that doesn’t mean they’re at the best were I think they can be",1
"“You know, when I was a kid. I used to think you were cool” 
This applies to so many companies and people who turned out to be terrible, I’ve honestly lost count.",0
"Friendly reminder that the underpayed and overworked customer support nintendo staff is not in fact the one that is in charge of the design of the joy cons nor the culprit of Nintendo's greedy practice.

Be civil, demand your rights but respect the poor human at the other side of the phone.",0
"From my experience, my drifting issues have largely been caused by dust. Blowing into the stick with compressed air or using Alcohol to clean them appears to do a pretty decent job at fixing the issue.

Still bullshit that we have to deal with this though, and not everyone is as lucky as I am and may need to get their stick repaired.",0
Those Splatoon joycons are nice!,1
"I'm finally going to try splatoon since there's a free trial and looking forward to harvestella. There are so many games I want coming out in September too. I'm looking forward to ooblets, Disney dreamlight valley, lemoncake, wyldeflowers, potion permit, and hokko life so far.",1
"Hopefully we get something for BotW2, probably more of MxR2, maybe a small bit for S&V. Finally, some good news to make the week better.😁",1
"Dang, I just want a Normal Direct. Even tho I'm excited about this I want a normal direct.",1
"Another botw2 trailer would be great, that or Wind Waker and Twilight Princess for switch announcement",1
I’m really excited for the September direct,1
"Hey! I've been a really big fan of your channel for a long time now, keep up the great work! But if possible and not to cause too much of an inconvenience, would it be cool if you added CST timezones as well? I know I could just convert the times online but I would feel a lot better and more confident about the absolute schedule if YOU were the one who also inputted a central timezone schedule. Again I'm not trying to cause any inconvenience, only if you're cool with it! Thanks! I really love your content, definitely, one of the best Nintendo intel providers I can rely on (and watch almost daily)!",1
"I want a new mainline Super Mario game!!! Also, they need revive franchises like F-Zero and Starfox!!",1
Zack finally has some good news 💀😂,1
"TBH I believe Mario+Rabbids belonged in that list, it had a great villain and a great problem creator. It also had great battle actions and cutscenes. I also love the fact that the villains of the game were mixed together with something to make them who they are!!!",1
"I got my first Switch a month ago, the OLED edition, and i gotta say its one of my favorite consoles ever. I started with the PlayStation 1, then the GameCube, Gameboy Advanced SP, Wii, Xbox 360, 3DS XL, then really got into PC games, and then stopped playing videogames for many years. So it was a delight getting the Switch specially because of the great games it has. My favorite so far have been Fire Emblem Three Houses, Animal Crossing New Horizons, and Smash Ultimate. Also really surprised with Mario Kart 8 its a lot of casual fun! Well this is my paragraph that no one asked for lol. Great video btw!",1
"5 years later, the switch library is amazing and I have most of these games. What a nice list of games :) Great video editing as well. Luigi's Mansion's animations/graphics are top tier. Pikmin 3 Deluxe is amazing on that as well and hope more people pick it up. Waiting on Pikmin 4. You have a new subscriber.",1
"Xenoblade 3 needs the first spot imo, such a beautiful and amazing game that actually manage to perfect a system that was already in place...",1
"definitely dragon dogma. for the best, most complex combat system and great character development so many factors come into play. npc companions learn player behavior, improve, can be borrowed from other players, and then come back with gifts and trophies and new knowledge. Class change at any time. A game that went down with the release of Skyrim, but remains one of the best fantasy RPGs to this day. the sequel, Arisen, finally brought a few more Fast Travel Crystals into play.",1
I'm not a big Mario fan but Paper Mario on Switch is really really good. Picnic Road and so many other soundtracks are sooooo good. Amazing game play too. Clean 8/10,1
As a OLED switch owner I have to say that it’s a great list BUT I’d include switch sports and mario party superstars in the honorable mentions. Those are the type of games that makes the nintendo switch be different than any other consoles in the market. The local multiplayer of this little thing called nintendo switch is nasty,0
As a person who lived through the dark ages of the wii u im so glad nintendo is back making so cool games for us since the switch released!!!!,1
"This looks a lot better than the version they showed last year. Smooth framerate, fast-paced action and over the top silliness. Welcome back Bayonetta. ❤❤",1
I’m hoping Jeanne plays more of a role in this game. It’s going to be the first time that she’ll be active throughout the story without being mind controlled. She really only appeared in the prologue and epilogue last time.,1
Bayonetta deserves even more shine. She may not be trending but this third installment will not disappoint!,1
"Guys if we can see how cool bayonetta looks with her new summons and moves, imagine Jeanne! I can’t wait to see the difference (hoping that Jeanne is playable and maybe even with her actual voice actor) 

Also I’m really loving the new bg music in the first scene it’s such a bayonetta genre of music",1
"The music, the story, the characters, the boss fights in the future… I’m getting hyped for this game! OwO",1
"Looks so good !!!!!!! That game clearly looks like platinum was given all the time in the world to make the game as best as they can on the switch , can’t praise Nintendo enough for keeping this franchise alive",1
"Nothing beats the hype of a good stylish action game, and this looks like a damn good follow up to two of the best.",1
"Bayonetta is gorgeous and her style with Lady Butterfly and her 'armor' is too dope,hope that the combat gets some more content besides the trailer,i'm thinking that some nuances and combat systems will show up in-game....
well,gotta rack up some cash to get this one day one! <3",1
At first I wasn´t convinced with the aesthetics of this game but the more i see this trailer the smoother it actually looks and the graphics does not seem bad at all,1
I think I'm the best singer on YouTube. Can't lie.,1
"Downloading the DLC from NSO feels a little confusing so maybe they just got too many complaints or questions about it, plus DLC on NSO is a key part of the benefits so they just want to have it covered. My take.",0
Idk man I think it’s smart to tell some parents (who are not gamers) how to download DLC because it allows them to give more exposure to their subscription (which I argue is a great value to those interested in the content it provides).,1
"I was recently thinking about what would be next for NSO+EP. And I thought it would be a great idea if Gameboy and Gameboy Colour get launched on the standard tier in September, whilst adding Gameboy Advance and Nintendo GameCube to the Expansion Pack tier in October, one year after the Expansion Pack tier had launched.

I also think that your idea of Super Mario Odyssey DLC being added would be brilliant!",1
The problem is it's not telegraphed well to the general user that they have access to the Mario kart tracks for example. They need to upgrade their UX and put it in the switch online section of the OS and also message it better. My guess when I saw this was that they can see loads of people aren't taking advantage of downloading DLC as part of their sub.,0
"After going through and seeing the user interface, the ""download"" button is not as prominent as the ""proceed to purchase"" button is obvious.  I can see people hitting the purchase button thinking that will get them to where they need to go, but then they see that they have to pay for it and get frustrated.  I have some experience with UX/UI design so that stands out.",0
"Wave race being here is pretty damn hype, hoping we get DK64 and uh.. maybe goldeneye soon",1
Virtual boy games for nintendo labo would be nice. As well as optional colour pallete swaps so you can either play in authentic red scale or have it recoloured to include all colours of the rainbow.,1
Splatoon 3 es una experiencia que ningún otro shoter puede ofrecerte aunque todo lo de Nintendo evidentemente cuesta dinero 😉😄,1
"1:27:09 Ehh, this line was pretty dumb. The game engine, Unity, has nothing to do with how the game feels when controlling. My apologies for this one!",0
"""'This isn't the Nintendo I grew up loving!'""
""Yeah, because you weren't paying attention back then.""
Easily your most cutting line to date.",0
"I really respect how Scott is a big Nintendo fan, but isn't fooled and pledging blind allegiance to them for nostalgia's sake. So many of the decisions they make can be so blatantly anti consumer and it blows my mind how some fans will hop in the line of fire to block any shots sent Nintendo's way; being extra dramatic and hardheaded no matter how egregious their actions may be.",0
"This video has the ""Scott the Woz"" feel all over it. It is definitely a video is it sure has been ""Five Years In"". 10/10",1
The fact that Balan Wonderworld and Breath of the Wild came out 4 years apart and both cost 60$ makes me unbelievably sad,0
"I’m going to be legit sad when the Switch era ends. This is the last Nintendo console that came out before i graduated. I’m having less and less time to play games but the few hours i put at them bring me tons of joy.
I hope i can have time for the Switch 2.",1
I’m seriously impressed how Scott can talk for over 2 hours and still keep it interesting. Even if I can’t watch it in 1 go I still come back to watch the whole thing,1
This was a joy to watch. I really like this series. Just wrapping up a whole year in sections is a great way to look back. This year felt pretty monotone for me. I wasn't over hyped for anything and as a pokemon fan PLA was cool but BDSP felt janky. Kirby was incredible. Kingdom hearts being cloud versions was the biggest let down for me though.,1
Can't wait! Cool to see some prolonged gameplay!,1
"3:19 Something I noticed that is SO small, but such a good detail is instead of abruptly stopping, they gradually skid to a stop. Amazing detail :)",1
"Is it just me or does it look like everyone will be able to dodge roll now and not just duelie mains? I think Splatoon three is gonna be easy to pick up but hard to master, nothing wrong with that though! Can't wait to meet everybody in the turf war!",1
"0:48 New inkzoka looks cool, looks very strong and the 3 shot limit really helps balance it out a bit. My Question however is if the rainmaker will take on this kind of “triple spiral shot” that the inkzoka has, as the rainmaker always takes after the cannon like special in each game. Would make for interesting ranked matches",1
"I really love the added player titles and medals awarded to the players at the end of each match. Not to mention, the music is HARD! Just 4 and a half months and the wait will finally be over!",1
"What I have gleamed from this is that I'll definitely be playing turf war a lot more in this installment. The specials look like they actually benefit turf war compared to the previous versions, and will definitely be a lot more fun overall in ranked modes. 

I love the aggressive approach to the specials too reverting back to what splatoon offered. It gives people a chance who normally wouldn't be able to dominant due to lack of necessary skill or just going against weapons that absolutely oppress them. I personally play short ranged weapons and it gets tough to approach when you are constantly matched up with mid to long-ranged weapons when your weapon doesn't have the kit to contend. Definitely a plus seeing brush being able to grapple, because in certain do or die situations the brush may be the last line of defense and deserves a chance to shine without constantly having to wait until opponents approach you.",1
"I can’t even! This game is going to be so good! The added player titles, the new music absolutely slaps. And the new victory animations and just. Everything else.",1
"This gameplay is awesome, and I am loving the music being played, especially now or never, it sounds more intense than the other splatoon games, really gives off the feeling that it is the last minute of the match, and the team that is losing must make a comeback fast.",1
I love the new display and gear. The new abilities fit the “City of Chaos” get up. I like how it shows what weapons we should expect to have their specials. Can’t wait to see if they release a test fire.,1
The fact this came from Kotaku means it can't be taken serious.,0
"Soo... let me get this straight. A person that refuses to reveal their identity (-1 point) tells a very fishy story (-1 point) without any proof (-1 point) for a joke that wasn't even sexual harassment (-1 point). Then, she revealed her(?) tragic story to Kotaku (-1 point).


Yeah, no lmao. I can't even take this seriously.",0
"You don’t get to say Stray is a racist game and have me take you seriously. One of innumerable examples. If people really are doing criminal/inappropriate things at work then punish them accordingly, but until someone with a shred of integrity reports it I will withhold judgement.",0
"If she thinks a couple of inappropriate jokes over the course of 9 years  is a ""harrowing experience"", she must live a very sheltered life.",0
"Someone making sexual jokes about fictional characters in a chat is not sexual harassment, it's not even directed at her. She wants it to be harassment specifically because she's a woman who was part of the chat.",0
"Oh kotaku, a very very “reliable/credible” source of information with no activist agenda nor creating drama to mine click or dehumanizing gamers.

Doesn’t kotaku have an axe to grind with Nintendo",0
"Yo automaticamente ya me salto el avance inicial (+2min) hasta después de la intro y ya tranquilamente escucho todo.
Qué ganas de Direct! 🥳 🥳 🥳",1
Tiene sí o sí prenestar algo Sony 😎🤘 y si es así... Será épico!!!,1
"Mario, Zelda y Metroid ♥️
Mi santísima Trinidad Nintendera vendrán con todo a romperla",1
I'm not sold on the new gimmick and frankly nothing will ever beat the sheer excitement mega evolution gave me but I'm really looking forward to play both of these games !,1
One day... one day I'd love to watch one of these pokemon presents and have a new shadow pokemon game be revealed.,1
"I'm really hoping we get to battle other regions champions in the end game, and who else prefers mega evolution.",1
WE FINALLY GETTING CRYSTAL ONIX!!!!,1
"It's finally heading the right way, arceus was just a tester for this bigger game, but they definitely need new hardware and get the graphics and framerate better for on TV's",1
I’m sooooo excited for “the abundant nature”,1
One day... one day I'd love to watch one of these pokemon presents and have a new shadow pokemon game be revealed.,1
"Perfectly said. I’ve been bringing up stuff like this for years, and I absolutely despise this double standard. You can love their games all you want (I certainly do), but Nintendo as a company is seriously one of the worst in the industry. Stop discounting everything they do just because you have good memories of them. This needs to be fixed not just at Nintendo, but everywhere.",0
Good stuff man. People being inconsistent is the only consistent part of the internet.,1
"When I was a kid in the early 90s you could still write a sloppy hand written 4 page letter with crayon drawings and send it to Nintendo of America and they would immediately write you back answering every single question you had no matter how dumb it was, and complementing your crappy drawings in detail. I think my Dad might still have some of their response letters in his desk. Those days are long gone.",0
"You’re 100% right. Everyone has to decide for themselves how serious this stuff is but at the end of the day there’s a lot of virtue signalling going on. Also, while we’re at it, let’s all admit that as much as people like to hate Kotaku, at least they’re willing to report this kind of stuff.",0
Here’s a hot take: Most hardcore gamers/tech workers who would in “nerd” stuff are going to be a bunch of socially awkward weirdos. This is why these things happen at all gaming companies and places like Gencon where they virtue signal but these virtue signalers are the ones who commit assault and/or harassment 🤷‍♂️,0
"It's good to see that you're always willing to speak your mind. In a time where anybody that speaks up on anything, will be bashed and harassed for being honest. The direction things are going in general on speaking out is sad.  Appreciate you and your brutal honesty brother.  🙌",1
"I like Nintendo games but not people who commit sexual harassment, which happens in too many places. Men and women do act in unsolicited ways towards others.",0
Congratulations RGT you’re finally learning what trends are. It seems Nintendo hasn’t trended negatively like Activision has so their opinions haven’t been altered.,1
I miss the days when you unlocked these things by playing the game at your own pace. Characters and stages were always cool rewards for beating the game’s challenges.,1
"Congratulations Nintendo, you did it.  You added what should have been there in the first place.",1
"Thank god the queen of Mario sports/party games is finally here, Daisy deserves better I absolutely love her! 👑",1
"Daisy should have been there from the first, but I am glad to see more than a single character in these updates

2, a stage, and gear. It's exciting but it also means my expectations were very low",1
"I do really appreciate how new characters still get hand drawn art to match everyone else. If all the dlc adds new stages, gear, and characters, then I’ll be coming back to this game for a long time.",1
"It’s about time Daisy came to this game, she should’ve been here from the drop, I am so hyped",1
This is a bare minimum update that should have been there day one. I want to see MUCH bigger updates in the future,1
"I'd never argue with new content entirely, so I'm grateful and happy they've added what they added here. I think if the game wants to see a potential sector for longevity, it would need to have a Spectator Mode and possibly proper 4v4 Online (where all players can be remote) so that there could be a tourney scene.
I myself would be hosting them regularly with a Spectator Mode client, but it could go eSports if they had a tournament scene like that. But like I say, I'm happy for any additional content being added to the game and I hope they'll consider modes/features for the updates to come!",1
You guys really need to start releasing your games with full content on release.,1
"Good to see them adding in more stadiums too, not just characters",1
I dont know why but its so nice seing people get nice things for themselves 💜,1
I think that this is the most beautiful unboxing for this Nintendo that I’ve ever seen 😻,1
Very nice!!!!,1
"hey ! just to let u know at 7:55 u go to press the power button on the switch to turn it on, but u can actually hold the home button on ur joy con to turn ur switch on as well :3! a lot easier especially if ur playing docked. hope this helps",1
ngl im not into this whole aesthetics vibe but ur videos have helped me find the right accessories for my switch and have made my days more peaceful. thanks peachdudu,1
"Oooh, the case is so cute! I like the peach one too hahah, nice to see you uploading again since you're way more active on Instagram.",1
The peach joycon looks so cute😍,1
All the accessories look so cute!,1
"Great video! Love how you style everything so cutely 💗 I really wish to get my own Switch OLED soon! Btw, where did you buy this tiny white TV looking thing in the back with the pastel buttons?",1
omg that’s so cool congrats on the new switch! this was so relaxing to watch,1
This is the same guy that said a screen protector is useless.,0
"""it's was like I was in space""
So they don't work, because there is no sound in space",0
Reminder: this was the same guy that said that a charging portable stand is useless because the switch has a kickstand,0
"""a fan for your switch is useless""
""haha here's a dust cover""",0
felt like i was in space (in space there is no noise),1
"Use other headphones, they work just fine.",1
"I'd like to see a 4K docked and 1080p handheld successor to the Switch that's backwards compatible and more powerful with better graphics, online and frame rate too.",1
What I need going forward is a Nintendo Switch successor that is backwards compatible and offers improvements to previously released games. I need to play Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Torna over again in true 1080p or at 1440p whether it be 30fps or 60fps. I just want them to be clear with further and more saturated draw distances and that dynamic resolution removed.  Of course this would benefit many other games but I haven't NG+ XC2 because I am hopeful I'll get to re-experience improved on new hardware.,1
"I actually feel Nintendo should probably leave their next gen design choice at the Nintendo Switch level. It's the perfect system whether you want a home console, portable or both. They should just focus on upgrading hardware on each gen or giving it refreshes with better design implementations like joycons with pro controller sticks. I'd also like to see more things the Switch could be paired with ..like linking to discord and Spotify and having them run in the background.",1
I wonder if No Man's Sky coming to Switch in October will incorporate some of this 'new' tech we've been seeing more of. Seems like a game like that will need all the help it can get to run smoothly on the Switch. I'm still really curious to see how it turns out. Likely will either be a pretty solid 30FPS or 30FPS with frame drops and low res. I suspect the low rest automatically in either case but I never played the game so I'm interested to possibly give it a try if it's a half decent port.,1
"I still love my Switch, but after owning the Steam Deck for a couple of weeks I have to say - Valve is doing a substantially better job supporting the Steam Deck then Nintendo is the Switch. I've already got more updates that have made the system even better in a couple weeks then Nintendo has in 5 years. Nintendo needs to take a page out of Valve's playbook here.",1
"I’d love to see Monolith apply this tech, either FSR 1.0 or DLSS when the newer model drops, in an update to Xenoblade Chronicles 2. All the Xenoblade games are in my ever-growing backlog, so I think I’ll wait to see if this actually happens 🤞",1
"SO, Should we do another one of these videos next time?! 😘

 Go to https://buyraycon.com/beatemups for 15% off your order! Brought to you by Raycon.",1
this feels like a special sitcom episode when the whole cast is in another country xD love it,1
"OG beatemups style content with a new crowd, this is great stuff wood always fun to go along on the hunt with you all",1
"Bob’s commentary made this video feel like a mockumentary 🤣
Also seeing vlog style Nintendo content recorded in NYC took me back to the CND & Etika days man 😭😭😭 such good times",1
There’s a part of me that was getting the vibe of old CND vlogs at the beginning there. Just seeing the store again brought me back to good times!! :),1
I love this new documentary style!  It's so nice seeing everyone have fun together!!,1
"God I want to go to the Nintendo store in New York so badly, it seems like it has so much cool stuff in it!",1
Bob's commentary makes everything better,1
"OMG, just loved hanging out with you guys in this video. It really reminded me of the time some friends and I used to go game hunting in São Paulo... like, about 20 years ago. Thanks for bringing those sweet memories back. I would definitely LOVE more videos like this one. 👏🏽❤️",1
Awe the Japan videos are the exact time I found you while researching if I wanted to buy my wife a switch for Christmas 😭💜,1
"I've had my Steam Deck for about a month now and your reaction to the weight was EXACTLY the same reaction I had. Everyone says it's ""so big"" but honestly when you hold it in your hand and feel that weight it makes everything go away. Amazing handheld.",1
Personally I’d much rather a free carrying case then fancy unnecessary packaging. I appreciate a company that’s forgo paying the extra bucks on packaging and placing it into something more functional to the consumer in the long run.,1
"The Steam Deck is an excellent friendly competitor. Nintendo's advantage is many great first Ip and tons of third parties. Not to mention name recognition, but the stream deck could make Nintendo focus on creating a Nintendo Switch Pro or Nintendo Switch 2 that has more power which I think is great because it puts more pressure on Nintendo to do better.",1
"I think fancy premium packaging would be cool, but I like the fact that they are trying to be less wasteful in comparison to other businesses.",1
"The packaging feels really nice and Valve-like. They made it simple and homey (if you get me) and it feels like a homemade dinner in comparison to the Switches package which would be compared to a fancy restaurant. The outside doesn’t matter, it’s the inside that matters; this couldn’t be more true with the Steam Deck!",1
"While the Steam Deck's performance handling these AAA games is impressive I'd really like to see more content creators focus on other aspects. The Steam Deck is a fantastic way for first timers to try PC gaming and it really has so much more to offer.
Where I feel it really shines is the extensive catalog of lesser known, smaller, and past titles.
(Basically pick any random, old, game and it will likely allow settings comparable to the rerelease/remaster releases that you have to wait for and pay extra on console. Older games often look much better on smaller screens too. So many should be fantastic on that little thing.)",1
One of my favorite uses for my Steam Deck was loading emudeck and having the virtual console I've always wished the Switch would be!,1
"This is the best Steam Deck I've watched - even out of all the tech youtubers and video game channels!

Love the up in the video production quality as well, Wood! Keep levelling up!! Awesome content!!!!!!",1
"Xbox is just going strong, and it's becoming the most preferred platform pretty quickly.",1
I’m actually hyped for Lies Of P and it’s day one on game pass man. Next years is going to be a crazy year for games.,1
"When they showed the Lies of P trailer and it was coming to Game Pass, and then it was given most anticipated PlayStation game, I laughed so hard",1
"Lies of P in Gamepass 🤩

Callisto Protocol looks amazing. I’m really looking forward to what Gamepass is bringing for the rest of the year.

Edit: Atomic Heart is still set to release at the end of the year. Another great looking Gamepass game day one",1
"PS fanboys: ""Game Pass is full of fodder that no one wants to play""
Also PS fanboys: ""Can't wait for Life of P""",0
"This year looking forward to: Moonscars, Scorn, High On Life, Darktide, Solar Ash.

Next year and beyond: Lies of P, Silksong, Redfall, The Last Case Of Benidict Fox, Starfield, Stalker 2, Avowed, Atomic Heart 2, The Outer Worlds 2, Hellblade 2, next ES, Fallout 5 and more.

So incredibly happy with my PC gamepass subscription, so much entertainment and savings☺️☺️☺️😁😁 Microsoft rocks!!!!",1
I doubt we'll get any new announcements anytime soon and I don't really care about indie games they're all kind of the same to me they just look different most of the time and about PC feel like they should work more on xbox and not PC and I have PC but that's me,0
I just can’t wait to play fable. That’s really the only game I’m looking forward to,1
High on life is going to be my go to game the gameplay they showed I believe is the first boss battle my bet the further you get into the game the bigger the boss the bigger environment you'll be fighting them in!,1
You're constantly putting out extremely well curated and delivered content. Thank you 💯,1
"Console exclusives aren't going anywhere. They would be insane to split market share off of their hardware, their ecosystem and ultimately their control. Nintendo has dominated both Sony and Microsoft this generation with the unreal success of the Switch. They are the proof in the pudding that hardware and exclusives are still what drive the consumer towards the platform.",1
"Destin, I think I enjoy your content because it pushes rational debates or argument. To the issue of exclusives. I think the strategy of MS has already been spelled out. 

What I think MS plans to do is make the console the foundation of their business strategy. They will have console exclusives, but they will not restrict their games to just the console device which is Sony's strategy. It just means they will release on multiple devices from PCs, to TV's, to mobile phones, and through cloud. MS has expanded agreesively.

But I personally do not think their games will go to Sony consoles like most people tend to think because Sony are their competition.",1
Phil Spencer said the day of the press conference welcoming Bethesda into the fold that it was about making games available on platforms where game pass exist so this is not anything new he's staying consistent.,1
I liked how they showed gameplay for all their games they showcased. Gives us an idea of what to expect.,1
This looks awesome I'm really excited for most of these games. I just wish the wait time for release wasn't so long though I respect the hard work being put in to develop them.,1
Probably the biggest W ever. Such amazing games and very well done to Xbox for doing this for us❤️ Xbox better forever ❤️❤️,1
Super happy about the pretty substantial single player games coming out. Not into online social multiplayer games at all so this was very much welcomed.,1
"Wow, I watched summerfest and was like WTF this could of been sent out in an email. This show blew it out of the water, so many GAMPASS games to actually look forward to, hopefully these games actually deliver in the hype",1
This game was very beautiful in 4k. In 4k we can see very details of the game. I hope BETHESDA continues the good work until the launch of it.,1
"Great presentation - Love the actual gameplay footage and variety of games. Very grateful for Game Pass, love this service!!",1
"Great presentation - Love the actual gameplay footage and variety of games. Very grateful for Game Pass, love this service!!",1
What do you think about the FUTURE of console EXCLUSIVES? Thanks for watching and LIKING the video! <3,1
Xbox says “game pass is the future…. Because we have it”….then “exclusives are doomed… because we have less than none”,0
Considering how well Nintendo exclusives sell on all their hardware and especially so on the Switch I find Phil's comments laughable,0
"I have had a love hate relationship with console exclusives. I get why they exist and why they draw consumers to a specific platform. This coming Phil along Xbox's track record concerning their exclusives since around 2013 and up, haven't exactly been praised as PlayStation's have been, this is more corporate weasel words. 

Xbox has cannibalized and quite frankly wore out their once golden franchises. Halo, Gears of War, um...I'm sure I'm forgetting some others. The line is going to get blurry with where titles between the respective console manufactures games end up for consumption. 

Xbox has doing really well with Game Pass, but they are missing that killer app for the system.",0
"Apart from Lies of P and Calisto Protocol, i really found ""Atlas Fallen"" to be really interesting, surprised no one is talking about this new game reveal. Also absolutely thrilled to learn that Lies of P will release day 1 on Game Pass, one of the few benefits of owning both Consoles that you get to enjoy the best of both worlds.",1
Lies of P looks incredible also Dead island looks like it could be good High on life looks very fun it was a good showcase lots of game but also lots of ads.,1
"This was a very solid Gamescom, especially loved the bit of trolling we got from Kojima. Seems like this event just keeps getting better every year",1
"Favorite reveal was gameplay of Lies of P coming to gamepass day 1😊😊😊😊

Yes looks and feels like it's gonna be awesome.

Definitely playing it, but yea 2023 is stacked.",1
I knew something was missing out of my daily life. Thanks for the vids Jay. Your work and content is so underrated.,1
High On Life is Conker but as a first person shooter I''m hyped for that game. Lies of P is the successor of Bloodborne. Callisto Protocol looking good. Sonic Frontiers I'm impressed. Atlas Fallen and Dead Island 2 oh yea! 👍,1
Pretty good show overall can’t wait for lies of P man 🔥🔥,1
"I agree that the show was average, but the Dead Island 2 reveal made my day. Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide are the most addictive zombie games I have played. I played both of them all the way to the end.",1
Thanks for watching! What consoles do you currently own?,1
"Just bought the series S. It looks great, loads fast and plays next gen games. I'll upgrade in a couple years when the series X is easier to find. It's worth it people",1
Series s is PERFECT for PlayStation players who want to expand their gaming library. After getting my ps5 I wanted a cheap way into the Xbox ecosystem and this has been an amazing console that I honestly grew to appreciate more than the ps5 due to the small size and price,1
"The deal breaker for me is not having a disc drive when I've amassed a huge collection of physical discs. That's why I got the Series X. However, for anyone new to Xbox or someone who doesn't own physical discs, this is a great purchase.",1
"I've owned both and the Series S has a special place in my heart. I love the X but unless you're rocking a TV that supports 4K120 w/ VRR, the Series S is just fine. Also, it's SO tiny and it's amazing what a quiet beast it is. But definitely buy the storage expansion card, regardless of which one you buy.",1
"The Series S is plain amazing, especially with GamePass and if you are into backward compatibility gaming. I've just completed the entire Gears series on 360 because I never got to play them back in the day (Gears 1 to Judgment) and it's been a pure blast. You can also find an online list of all the games who received an FPS boost (including Xbox and Xbox 360 games) so there's that too. Some are now locked at 60 and some are even at 120 FPS. Yes my last name is Spencer how did you know?",1
The only next gen console I could find was this one. Have owned it for about a year. 0 regrets. Would buy it again. Its amazing. Its form factor blows my mind. So tiny but so powerful,1
I definitely have no complaints with the Series S. From what I've seen 1440 is still more than adequate for graphics and it runs super smooth and is still a very quick console.,1
"I was totally blown away by my series s 
I still can’t believe what you can get there for 300 bucks
Still I upgraded to series x because I’m used to pc quality and the extra fps and native resolution is totally worth investing the extra money 
Still I would totally go for the series s. 
It’s super quiet performance is mind blowing And it’s pretty small 
I guess this time Xbox is superior to PlayStation even though everybody is freaking out about ps5 and is probably sleeping on the new Xbox consoles though they’re way better 
X is more powerful and the s is a absolute price performance killer 

I didn’t expect to be that happy with Xbox after being used to a high end pc",1
"needless to say that the Series S is actually easy to find and purchase, while getting a Series X for not more than original retail price is difficult",1
"I love your content, animation is smooth, audio isn’t weird and bad and the information is so interesting to watch.",1
So much nostalgia.. I remember every weekend getting out of school going to my friends house and playing halo for hours on the original Xbox .. the good ol days man,1
seeing the halo game clips brought tears to my eye. I remember first playing it on the original xbox and wow... best way to introduce me into a game franchise. I love being born in the 2000's :),1
"When the first Xbox came out, it had some awesome games on it. A decent amount of games. As it evolved, games started fading for the system. It gained way more power etc each time but lacked games with each update lol.

Now we have the ultimate series x. Microsoft figured since there’s no games for the system for real, they gave it the ability to play pc games as well .",1
"In a few years when you have millions of subs, I'll be glad to call myself an OG",1
Really well made video. Packed with useful information and great editing. Keep it up.,1
When this man hits millions I’ll be happy that I was a part with him through out his journey,1
I've been Xbox ever since the first one and I own all 4 generations of the consoles and in my opinion the 360 was the best one for user interaction as it was simple enough yet an excellent experience,1
"If I were the viewer who sold this to you. I would be crying right now.

As a hobby repairman, it surprises me how many times I buy something broken, and it's just dirty or unplugged. Baffling really.",0
"Man, that dude got scammed. Such a simple fix, how do repair shops like that even exist",0
"Ahh yes, the repair equivalent of making sure the device is plugged in 😄 I bet you enjoy these once in a while.",1
Nice job Steve!  Love an easy one every once in a while!  👍,1
Great content as always . Teaching a younger generation all about right to fix,1
"Honestly, i think having the perfect amount of thermal paste is what did it 😂",1
Great job steve!! We all need easy fixes hahahaha!  Good luck to whoever wins!!,1
"I bought a used Star Wars Xbox 360 and the controller they set me had a problem with the left bumper. I was inspired by you so I got a screwdriver, opened it up, and managed to fix it! Thanks for making the videos and inspiring others!",1
"Working on railways messing around with circuits for a living I hate troubleshooting when it's something simple we've just overlooked. Last fault I had that I was there for fixing was literally a diode being the wrong way round. Cost 4 fuse, hand tracing and belling all the connection points before finally we found the diode was the wrong way round 2 hours later. It's always the last thing you check. Love seeing this kind of content when it's an easy fix",0
"Malheureusement c'est toujours les mêmes promos et les mêmes prix, c'est soulant a la longue, sur le ps store les prix sont gonfler pour faire croire a un eventuel ""promo"" 😒😒😒il y a 1 mois metro exodus gold edition a 9'99 euro et la le jeu seul a 10,49euros😒😒😒",0
On parle trop de Sony et peut de Microsoft 😥,0
Ac odyssey un des meilleur assassin’s creed 😓,0
"I'm more of an Xbox person, but I still respect PlayStation.",1
For my personal budget I grabbed an Xbox series x primarily because of game pass which has been an amazing experience . Hopefully after tax season I’ll be able to find a ps5 . The Sony exclusives are the one thing that I’m missing on my Xbox but having both of them along with the switch would be a harmony of mathematical precision lol I think all consoles are wonderful in their perspective but together it’s gamers paradise .,1
"I’m a fan of gaming, not a fan of a specific company. I enjoy both systems!",1
"My 1st console was the original PS.  Loved it so much that I stayed with them and upgraded to PS2.  Somewhere in there I picked up a used xbox because my 1st Lan party with Halo just blew me away.  Then 3rd gen consoles came and both the price of games and consoles went above what I was willing to spend at that time so I turned to Nintendo and was happy to play their handheld systems.  Getting the Xbox series X was an easy decision for me.  I have Nintendo Switch for my exclusives, strategy, and rpg needs while the Xbox satisfied my craving for FPS and games that required higher processing and graphical power.",1
I like them both like they both have great exclusives and great hardware and stunning traffics where it is hard to tell the difference between reality and non reality they both are amazing systems,1
"You quickly mentioned that online depends on where our friends also play.  That is a win for the Xbox, because it has direct integration with PC.  You can chat with anyone on PC, but also directly play with them in a slew of GamePass games that silently support cross-play between PC and Xbox.  Playstation is doubling down on the walled-garden approach to keep people buying their brand through sunken cost and social ostricization (perpetuating the console wars, really).  No brainer, Microsoft is the one doing far better on supporting multiple platforms and opening the experinece to a larger audience, including online.",1
You are absolutely brilliant at reviewing stuff. Clear and concise,1
"This looks really fresh, definitely gonna check this out in release",1
This looks absolutely ridiculous. I'm all for it.,0
"Theme, art, combat, everything looks so well crafted. Wish the story too holds up to make it an awesome game",1
This game looks very promising there's not many dark souls clones that actually succeed but this has potential,1
looks insane. big win for gamepass,1
"This seems too good to be true. Beautiful and very unique aesthetics, with souls combat mechanics. Fingers crossed for this one!!",1
Another elseworld style videogame. I'm excited to see what they will do.,1
So far the coolest thing I think I've seen in Gamescom this year 😳,1
Absolutely cannot wait to play this DAY ONE on Game Pass. Man this looks amazing.,1
I was once in line at a GameStop to buy a used PS3 when a guy got in line behind me to trade in his PS3. So i bought the PS3 off the guy for less then what GameStop was selling them and more then what he would have received from the store. We both won on that day.,1
"As someone I used to work for GameStop, my advice is to always buy the Used system over the Refurbished ones. The refurbished ones were broken at one point, and whoever fixes them doesn't do a great job.",0
"I was a manager at Electronics Boutique 20 years ago and we had the same problem with the PS2 “company refurbs” and they usually didn’t operate. I told my staff to unpack them when they came in, immediately mark them as defective and ship them back out. We had gotten burned too many times, and I wasn’t gonna put my customers through that anymore.",0
"I sold my Xbox One X a few months ago (on eBay), and whew... this video makes it seem like I really sold mine for far, far too cheap!  I'm one of those people that keeps everything -- including the foam wrap, plastic bags, and twist ties -- so the console looks pretty darn good once I get it all back together.  I can imagine that the only reason you'd want to buy from Gamestop is just the ease if something is wrong, and familiarity.  Also, they don't know me, but they know Gamestop.",1
"I worked at GameStop for 5 years and that is by far one of the most unacceptable packing jobs I’ve seen. The first console you opened was likely in terrible shape when it was traded in; it’s common for those refurbished ones to have panels replaced or be opened up and fixed from the inside out. I bet it’s missing the rubber pieces on the bottom because it’s been resurfaced in some way. The second console was likely just a trade in tested by an employee for under 5 minutes. With these consoles, very little is done before they’re repackaged and sold.",0
I used to work at gamestop and I can say they didn't give us enough packing supplies to ship out orders,0
"I hope there will be more games hitting 120fps at at least 1440p. If not with the Series X, then definately release a Pro mid-gen refresh asap.",1
I would love to see a series x pro version with a bit more power to run flight simulator properly especially with so many addons  that tax the system and a increase in FPS for flight sim would be great .,1
I think a pro series x with wifi 6 and  more powerful chip would be nice. They could keep the same ssd,1
I think game pass will have 35 million subscribers at the end of next year. All the game releases and activision/blizzard games in game pass will surely add alot to it!,1
"It's nice to see a channel dedicated to Xbox. 
So many other channels are all about the switch or ps4 and 5
Ive always been a huge xbox fan and i love my series x",1
The medium ground of these two consoles would probably be a Xbox series x sized console or thinner but slightly more powerful than the series x is,1
"I'm a huge playstation fan picked up the ps5 day 1 , I just picked up a series X a few days ago and I gotta say I'm pretty damn impressed get both if you can !",1
I am all for a series S plus having a disc drive and more storrage. Must buy.,1
"Was very interested in Redfall when announced.
Loving the new details and thought put into the game.
A day one for me, even if on gamepass.",1
"Gamepass is such an amazing service,i mean at first it was ok but NOW and next year …WOW!Can’t wait for all these games to release day one!!",1
"There is no ""loop hole"" for how Death Stranding made it to Game Pass PC. As some have already commented, 505 owns the PC rights, so they're free to put it on anything they want. Sony owns the console rights to DS, so this is why it will probably never come to Xbox consoles, unfortunately.",0
Redfall  is going to be sick 🔥🔥,1
"Hell yeah!!!

Can't wait for Gamescom!",1
Game pass has been a great service for me I love all the games that come day one that save me so much money by not having to even buy them it’s great.,1
"I play on pc... I've been a console gamer forever... since 1985... but I built a PC recently with an 11600k and a 3070ti, I play my Xbox on pc... I call it my series pc.

Redfall is looking AWESOME!!!",1
"Dang, they are sweating the details! That looks fun, and the fact you can solo play, awesome!",1
Even though I don't have children or any family members who have an XBox Series S or X I think the family plan is a great deal. I am cool with paying the $15 a month for just myself though.,1
This is awesome! I can’t believe they’re doing it as they have no real monetary reason to do it other than consumer good grace.,1
Personally I'm stoked for the family plan.,1
"Would be nice if the Family Plan had different levels that we could pay for !!

So we can pay for how many people we want to share with in our family, so if I only have 1 person I want to share with then it should be cheaper than a Family Plan that allows 5 people to share.....This would be Great imo !!",1
This is such a great feature!,1
Series S + Game Pass is the most fun I've had with gaming in many years,1
If only Microsoft has a phone plan for all carriers honestly I saw it was for Verizon but I want it for boost mobile so u could pay your phone plan and including the plan with a monthly Xbox live service so every month u could just plan your phone bill and be able to play on Xbox,1
I want my Xbox s to be a always online server for gaming and with the new deal with unity maybe some game dev oooooo,1
Well we do have some really bad ass games on game pass already and if they ain't planning any new additions this yr we should be good.. honestly it's not a big deal for me personally 🤷 I run both xbox series S and X which honestly its been more series S than the X. And ps5 so I'm good on games lol 😆 dude I have thousands of games already on both platforms 🤣. So yea and atm I'm back on forza horizon 4 and 5 and elden ring and dark souls 3 and demon souls remake. So I'll be busy for a while so if they wanna sort things out for us on GP I'm ok and I'm sure many of us are.. xbox has been really good to us ya know. They take a huge hit just for us to have fun and that's why I love xbox. They truly try to help us out with lowering the prices of the series S and X and keeping game pass cheap and keeping a ton of games on it. Yeah games on Xbox store is higher than picking up the disk for ps4 n ps5 ect but still they do good by us with Game pass n the cheap as hell monthly bill and the already low price of the series S n X...  and i don't understand why ppl are shit talking the Series S.... dude I love mine I have 3 of em 🤣 🤣.  And it can do 4k Microsoft already said it does lmao.. and all ya gotta do is when you plug it up to your TV go to settings display settings and select 4k 60hz or 4k 120hz what ever your TV or monitor does.. and then start a Game... and then take the TV remote and hit the OK button.... your TV will tell you what the series S is putting out to it... mine shows 4k 60hz Hdr10 DD and the games look beautiful and smooth.. yeah it's not as nice as the series X but it's Def not 1080P it's a higher resolution 100% and I don't see how someone can get 1080p by looking at it lol.. 1080p don't look that damn sharp n good lmao... and just look at the ps4 pro specs... the ps4 pro is a 4k correct??.... well the series S has better specs has better hardware... the same or a Lil more Tflops as well... the series is is a Zen 2 which is a AMD 3k series a RTX machine... it will do 4k just not as well as its bigger brother the X...,1
"0:45 - I miss this 

I used to play a lot of halo with my brothers. I was 6 or 7 back then and never realized just how good I had it. This sound kinda just sums up my amazing childhood and the golden age of gaming that just isn’t the same nowadays.",1
"0:46 this, this is it. This gave me so many memories.",1
"The good ol’ memories of the OG Xbox and 360 startup. Ahh, good times.",1
"The 2001 original Xbox was my first one! Got it in 2004 though because I haven't heard of it until the fall of 2003 from my uncle, besides Halo. Now here I am at 25 still loving it!",1
0:45 one of the best sounds to hear as a kid,1
That og 360 startup was sooo fresh as a kid,1
"I was 6 years old and would spend hours watching my brothers play Skyrim, cod Black ops 2 multiplayer/zombies,  prince of Persia, Minecraft, Batman, dead space.

Black ops 2 holds a very special place in my heart, even tho I never really got to play those games just watching my brothers play em was fun enough for me, I would do anything to go back to those day's, to get excited whenever I heard the Xbox start up sound, even tho I couldn't play games till I was older just watching my brothers gaming adventures and playing online with my other brothers, that was fun enough for me.


Brings back Alot of nostalgic memories.",1
0:45 The nostalgia from this sound alone makes me want to cry.,1
I still own my xbox 360 because there are games I still enjoyed playing from them. The startup still sounds breathtaking,1
These are so helpful. I wouldn't know about more than half this stuff if it wasn't for these weekly updates,1

"Great video.  Towards the end when you talked about the customer that brought the device back for something else, I greatly like the metaphors you gave him, such as the mechanic.  

I've only have one customer that did that to me and I told him as gently as possible to never darken the entry to my shop with his shadow again.  Nice to hear your kinder way to approach this.",1
"More over, Alex exposing us to a lead solder smell and grinding dust!",0
Great story on the ps4 fix with the controller problem afterwards! Had these kind of situation so much at my previous job!,1
"Amazing work, great fix. you just can't help some customers, you have to ignore that so you don't get too annoyed about it.  it's enough if you have to get angry about such statements.  this is also a learning process, like your example with the uv light over the camera.  just don't think about it too much😂.
Great video, thank you",1
"I really don’t understand people that argue over which systems better, I’m into videogames not companies that don’t even know I exist except as a number for sales. I have and will continue to have any Xbox,PS and Nintendo.  Loyalty to any of those is ridiculous. Trust me guys, they care about your money. Not your loyalty.",0

Hearing the 360 always gives me a huge load of nostalgia.,1
"The PS2 start up gives me goosebumps every time!! That was my childhood.

Edit: And Gamecube!!! Almost forgot about that one!",1
10 years from now all these startups are going to be extremely nostalgic,1
"the playstation 2 startup menu just gives me an unthinkable amount of nostalgia. just the sound of the startup gives me goosebumps. i remeber playing sonic, steet fighter and all sorts.",1
4:22 is the most nostalgic for me. That was the only console we had (other than xbox360 but I never played it) and it was very fun,1
"Gaz is spot on in regards to Xbox' marketing. It is an Xbox problem and their marketing in many european countries is either non-existent or incredibly limited. They have a good product with a good service and software, yet in many europeans markets they are being outsold 10-1 because they either don't know how or where to market their product or their budget is super limited.",0
Thanks for a other great show guys! ✊,1
I have a feeling Perfect Dark will nail the future forward atmosphere that was what I wanted from Initiative in the 1st place something new and refreshing,1
the reason the digital and physical games cost the same is because the retail stores thru a fit!!!   if people could buy the digital game cheaper the stores would be stuck with the disks !!!,0
"Hey guys, love your work. I went to pre-order Modern Warfare 2 from the Xbox store yesterday, and was quite surprised to find that it’s priced at £69.95 - have you covered this? I think it may be the first £70 Xbox game I’ve come across.",1
"When a game says their new game is bigger than their last game, The people whining saying ""A bigger map means the game wont be dense!"" Are just complaining to complain. They do not know shit if the game is more dense or not. That is just a deflection of an actual reaction or thought with any real substance. 
I guess I am just sick of these people who are sick of studios being proud of making their games bigger than their previous. If the game is not out or being played by reviewers at least... Then lets just be patient and wait until we are playing it instead of saying some BS comments are are being made up out of complete guesses pretty much. 

I truly like how Gaz does not hold back on any side, PlayStation or Xbox. N will tell it how it is, that is refreshing. But him bitching about the Red Fall map when he didnt even watch the new 21 minute video the studio put out. Plus their was some new shit being show, So I dont even know what Colt was complaining about that Arkane did not show anything new in the video when they had the chance to or whatever he was saying.",0
I'm a gamer of all consoles. I have only ever had to do one return and it was on Playstation. Had my money back in my account in about 45 minutes. I was surprised. Love gamepass!!  Have a great day 😀,1
"Id  could make a good blade or Arkane they did a great job on dishonored,  prey, deathloop",1
You did a great work with this new makeover  colt .. and gaz look incredible now 😁see i did say it will be clean and niiice 😀 the audio sounds alot better imo now # xstalkerx dk (on xbox),1
"I think in the future the value of having the series x will grow exponentially, when you look at the number of studios Microsoft has been acquiring, and with fewer cross gen titles limiting Devs from using the full power of the next gen consoles.",1
"I’m very happy with my Series S, and I’ve been all about physical media before I got it. I do plan on getting a series X eventually, but I’ve just been playing digital games on my Xbox One most of the time because of Game Pass Ultimate. After thinking about it, I realized my physical library on Xbone was substantially smaller than my PS4 library or Switch library, so I didn’t really feel bad about getting the Series S and an external hard drive. Even though my 360 library was pretty big, I’ve been able to get a lot of my favorites on sale for like $3 each digitally. When the Series X becomes more available and becomes a bit cheaper, I’ll get one but for now I’m really enjoying my Series S",1
As someone on a budget the series s is great game pass makes it really great especially with the deals u can get and just using external hard drives are a better option because transferring games is better than paying half the price of the console for the ssd so yeah if u have more money maybe get the series x but it just depends on ur situation,1
"I have a decent amount of physical games from the original Xbox, 360, and one so I feel justified getting the Series X especially because it has superior fps at 4K resolution. The problem right now is many games are cross gen so nothings really pushed the series X to its limits yet. If you still have a one X and plan to get a Series X later and can wait, you can update the Internal HDD to a SDD on the One X. It’ll load games twice as fast as before but still probably twice as long as the Series S. The One X has a better graphics card than the series S, previous games optimized for the One X will look better on the One X than on the series S. However cross platform games are probably going to have a better FPS than the X do to the better CPU. There’s a lot that goes into this stuff. 

Another factor to consider is the quality of your tv. I’ll be looking to pair my Series X with a new OLED tv here soon and then I’m 200% sure I’ll feel justified with the purchase.

Also I game a lot so 30, 60, 120 frames a second… I notice the difference. And in no way shape or form would I feel justified having a next gen console (Series S) that can’t even keep up with my old 4K tv.",1
"Thank you for sharing your experience with these consoles and not ""fan boying"". Speaking your truth will help alot of people who are on a budget. People constantly spread the narrative of digital games are horrible but why when the majority of the world doesn't but movies or music. I'm all for digital downloads and will only purchase physical games if it's attached to a special edition that I'm truly a fan of",1
"In your own words: ""Do I really want an XBOX? No. Do I really need an XBOX? No. But I feel like I work hard and I deserve it."" In reality, since the day you stepped onto the XBOX Series platform, you have been trying to convince yourself that you need something you didn't really want, that's foolish logic. The next time you don't want something, don't buy it because you think you work hard and deserve it.",0
"I bought a Series S when it first came out and a 3 year gamepass subscription. Was pretty impressed with the little beast but soon ran into the lack of free space to install games.  So I decided to sell the S and buy the Series X. Had the X now for a year  but the other day I suddenly realised that I hadn't turned on my series X for a week. And before that it was just sporadically. So decided to sell.  BUT,  I didn't want to completely move away from gaming and I managed to find an absolute awesome deal on a Series S.  140 euros with 2 controllers and 1 of those controllers is the 20th anniversary edition.  Going to sell that,  which will make my Series S end price probably around 60 euros. Can't get better than that!  For casual gamers,. like myself,  the Series S is a fantastic console.",1
"Big mistake!  I own both the X Box Series X and PS 5 and alot of the older games from previous gen releases run and look alot better on the X Box Series X.  Even some of the current gen titles look better on X Box Series X.  Also, Microsoft's recent buy outs with Bethesda, Activision and potentially other gaming software companies means future releases like COD and Skyrim releases may be X Box Series X exclusives.",1
"Got my Series X on Friday, and I’m really impressed with it. The visuals are jaw dropping.",1
"I went from a One S to the Series X and the jump to 4K 60fps is pretty significant, everything feels much smoother and everything loads faster (thank god for SSDs). The only issue is that there aren't really any games out right now designed specifically for the Series X with the exception of the medium aha",1
"I've been a life-long PlayStation fan, but after looking at the beauty and power of the new Series X, I just may get one.  I'm enjoying the PS5 too.",1
"As a huge PlayStation fan, That packaging is another level 👀",1
"I’ve had my series X for a week and I’m still in love with it, the visuals and overall gameplay of the games are amazing, I can’t stop playing Microsoft flight sim because of how beautiful it looks and how well the console runs the game. Strongly recommend if your an Xbox fan",1
"Great job here. Man, that is so beautifully lit, filmed and cut. It looks literally perfect! Would you ever consider making some tips how to film like that? Re the Series X, it's such a shame supply sucks. I've been lucky enough to source one, but it's such a wonderful machine that should be in so many more houses!",1
Just got the Xbox and my friend got the ps5 and honestly they did amazing with both consoles it’s at the point in time that it doesn’t really matter what system you have unless u want exclusives all games now a days are crossplay love both systems 💯💯💯,1
"Thanks, really helpful.  I just got my Xbox one series X, and like how you walked through the unboxing and setup.",1

You know you can just get rechargeable ones for Xbox?  I have two and it’s great!  Some people just like using batteries but every one is different,1
I've been using rechargeable batteries for over 12 years. And I can use them for other electronics as well,1
"You know, if you just spend an extra $10-20, you can buy rechargeable batteries for Xbox controllers 🙃",1
You know you can just get rechargeable ones for Xbox i haver two and it's great some people Just like using batteries but every one different,1
Man put batteries in the wrong way,0
As a Playstation fan I really hope the deal goes through! They’ve relied on cod marketing to boost their sales since the beginning of the last gen. Sony will have to innovate and become more attractive in other more interesting things than COD.,1
This is ridiculous does Sony not understand the deal is going through no matter what it’s business PlayStation does it all the time,0
"I personally like that Xbox is being so aggressive. I got tired of them playing nice a long time ago, especially considering that Sony has never extended to them the same courtesy.",0
"The part at 5:00 explains it clearly, this is why I have such a huge problem with Sony right now. The sense of entitlement and pettiness coming from them is infuriating. Seems like this is all about gamepass and other moves by MS changing the industry, and now Sony is upset because they have to compete on more even ground and are resentful about it.",0
"that's the console war we need. This kind of competition gets the best out of both companies, and it means Ws for all of us consumers",1
"I primary  play on PS but recently got back into Xbox for the first time since Xbox 360 so I’m happy to see Xbox actually do well because it pushes Sony to do better.  When I see twitter I see so much venom from both sides and it’s super sad to see, i just love video games man why can’t we just enjoy it.",1
"I have both PlayStation and Xbox, and I like how this competitive climate is forcing change on both sides. Microsoft was foundering during the last generation, so they introduced Game Pass, which forced Sony to step up their game with PS Plus. Competition ultimately benefits the consumer. Things are getting spicy with these acquisitions, but being on both platforms, I'm content to let them duke it out for my money.",1
"Boy, that escalated quickly. I mean, that really got out of hand fast. – Ron Burgundy.",0
Documents like this are why Microsoft have the best lawyers in the world. They go through it with a fine tooth comb and they’re like “yep. Send it.”,1
Ssundee never disappoints to get everything into among us,1

Thank Phil for putting Sonic Tails and a Chao in the mod.,1
The guitar hero reference was all I needed. Thank you.,1
(6:55) I’m still laughing at this part of the video.,1
For the past year I’ve only had a Nintendo switch . I’m a PlayStation guy but found the series’s S at an incredibly low price so I had to buy it. So far next gen gaming is great and this video is a big help to someone like me who is not only new to next gen but Xbox in general . Thank you,1
"A few of these are applicable to xbox one and have been for a couple of years especially the google/alexa voice control and the app based functions.

I didn't know about programming universal remotes to your xbox thats cool",1
Kudos to people like you who make videos like this to inform people of what they're missing!,1
These consoles are so impressive. It’s like “if you know you know”. So underrated,1
I’m so glad I managed to get a series x had it about a year now and love it have not played games since the Xbox 360 days and I can say it’s a massive leap haha,1
This was extremely informative great information 👌🏿,1
I noticed when looking at my recent captures in the xbox series s that some of the screenshots on 4k games claim to be 4k or in some instance 4k hdr which I thought was interesting,1
Thanks for such informative video. I just got a Series X few days  ago and I’ve learnt many new things from you video. Appreciate the effort!,1
Half of this applies to the Xbox One already. Some is cool and new though.,1
On the series x I hate how if you have a enhanced game saved somewhere other than the internal or the hard drive for the back it will always want too update the same games over and over,0
The fact they managed to get Lies of P into Game Pass day one is nuts at this point Xbox can damn near get any 3rd party game into Game Pass,1
You know Dirt I can honestly say I'm literally overwhelmed with good games on games pass just finished Sniper elite 5 loved it bout to play Thymesia and midnight fight express and I absolutely know it's going to get even better in the months to come great video brother keeping it real as usual thanks !,1
"Almost every industry is going subscription based, why wouldn't gaming? Its going to happen and at least Microsoft is at the helm and doing it right. I feel completely respected as a consumer and it seems, to me, to be healthy for gaming.",1
Microsoft acquiring these studios is t just about games. It's about the new virtual metaverse Micosoft and Zuckerburg are trying to build. and having companies that already work in this industry will pay massive dividends later.,1
Still can't believe sony is crying over games going to Xbox gamepass. You can't make this stuff up.,0
"Its about the cash. Tencent makes more revenue annually than both Xbox and Nintendo combined and they make zero exclusives.

And saying you pay more to support the devs is like saying you're glad to pay more at the gas pump so you can support Exxon and the people working at the refineries. Its so dumb.",0
Sony had a 26% drop in software sales and had to lower sales expectations for 2022 they aren't even supporting the developers themselves,0
"Good to see AA and AAA games coming day one to gamepass, that's what REAL gamers want to see, not these pissy little indie garbage like cooking simulator, microsoft gamepass was firing on all cylinders in 2021, they need to bring that energy back because 2022 has been a very weak year for xbo, but atleast they got us looking forward to 2023. PS, High on Life was delayed, it's not 2022 anymore I believe.",1
"You sir, just hit nostalgia heaven for me.",1
I loved that the old dashboards were so stylish back then. I hope we get a new one in 2021 for Xbox one and Xbox Series.,1
The original 360's dashboard was so cool looking. Id like to use it over the latest one,1
"something that always seemed better to me about the 360 ​​over PS3 was its interface, it was better, more modern and more intuitive",1
I’m a huge Playstation guy but one of my favorite things about Xbox is their startup screens. They’re all uniquely amazing.,1
"For me the sounds are what's taking me to my Childhood, thats amazing",1
Grateful that I lived through the golden era of gaming,1
Even though i never had a 360 it’ll always be iconic cause I remember going to friends house or my cousins house and booting it on to play minecraft or halo,1
3:15 I grew up right here and I am proud of it.,1
i honestly can’t wait to play it on my series s!,1
Now this looks amazing! praying sega delivers with this game,1
hope this turns out good 🤞🏼,1
Really hyped for this one,1
CANT WAIT TO PKAY THIS ON MY SERIES S AHHHHHH!!!!,1
Then enemies give me twilight princess vibes. 😄,1
"Looking better, but I will still need to see reviews after that first showing.",1
Was I the only one foaming at the mouth while watching this phenomenal showcase?,1

I Hope that this game will be Amazing",1

"The reason for the input delay is obtain the drivers , windows is owned by Microsoft with Xbox too, so drivers are found much easier than sonys way of obtaining drivers",1
"series x has been great for me, with variable refresh  rate and 120fps it is a massive improvement in performance than my previous One X.",1
I love when Jerian makes videos like this 🙏🏻,1
"I think once developers start to use velocity architecture, mesh shaders, direct storage, FSR2.0, VRS2.0 the full toolset then we will see some amazing results from this little beaut.. especially as the biggest issue is lack or RAM which with direct storage n velocity they will able to use the SSD as a Virtual RAM pool. the console has a lot of potential but depends if the developers use the toolset available to them when the features become available. especially as we know the GDK is New for this gen and a lot of features are still being developed and improved upon.",1
"I think for the price (I got mine used for 180 euros) paired with a nice 24"" 1080p IPS monitor the Series S is very good value. As you said I have found Forza, FSX and Halo to run great. To your point regarding storage space I also agree that just having space for the couple of games you are currently playing is perfect. On previous Xbox consoles I would find I'd fill up the HDD with loads of games due to Game Pass and a few other purchases and never got time to play them properly.

Oh lets not forget the Series S is a fantastic emulation box more than capable of running many consoles.",1
"I have a PC with a 3060 in it, I have a Nintendo Switch, and I have a Series S... i have never had an issue with how the Series S runs games because my xbox is mostly for game pass, and games that run perfectly fine on the console, like NBA 2k. Optimizations for new console generations take quite some time and I'm patient, and it is not a new issue. The PS4 had its issues, the xbox one x had its issues, they were fixed, people complaining should calm down.",1
"For weeks I was using the Series S as my main console unintentionally because it turned out that I was playing more where I thought I would play less. I had no complaints, it was really good. I eventually switched but it's not like I felt there was much of a problem.",1
"I got both, I got the SX in my living room and the SS in my guest room.

The SX is my primary gaming machine, while the SS is setup to be more of a streaming device. Even if the SS gets left behind because of gaming advancement, it still holds value as a multimedia device.",1
"I bought my series S on 21st jul 2022. its my first console ever and been almost a month since i got it. I absolutely love it. idk why i see people complaining about the resolution. I got it plugged in on my 4K 55"" TV and boy games look amazing. I have been playing Halo infinite, Forza horizon 5, FiFA 22, Hades, two point campus, Ori and the wisp, & turbo golf racing. and after all these games, i still have around 143 gb left. so no complaints about storage either. I am totally enjoying it.🙌💯",1
I absolutely love the portability of the series s.,1
"These next gen consoles should've shipped with more storage to begin with (especially considering they're backwards compatible with last gen). But atleast Xbox lets you connect more then 1 storage device.

If you don't mind moving games. I'd suggest getting an ultra small flashdrive (like the Sandisk Ultra Fit). You can easily fit 2 on the back USB ports on the Xbox giving up to 1TB of more storage. While still having room the expandable SDD too. Plus you can play the older Xbox One games off the flashdrive.

Sure you can do the same thing with a normal harddrive. However using an ultra small flashdrive takes up no extra space. Meaning it's easier to fit in an entertainment center. Plus it makes it easier if you move your console often.",1
"Quick resume is a god tier feature. PC my main platform, but damn the quick resume on my series S is something else. Brilliant for getting in quick games before work when you've not got much time!",1
"I'm just happy to get constant improvement to the system , big pat on the back Microsoft for doing this .",1
"The only negative I’ve had with streaming a game is the image quality can be quite lacking. Some games look better than others tho.

Great video today Ray! I enjoy many of your videos to get my Xbox fix. Nice interview today I love seeing a dev’s perspective on their work or other games on the market! Keep up the great work dude!!!,1
Props to Microsoft they are truly killing it this generation. Hopefully Sony will step up their game instead of slacking behind the entire time. Or even better drop their exclusives on pc day 1 with another subscription,1
"One very unrelated subject that annoys me.
Even though I would love that every game had the play anywhere feature.
I get Microsoft can’t really force third party companies like Ubisoft, to jumó aboard , they make a lot of money from people having to re-buy the same game.

But atleast there should be a way to keep your progress.

I jumped from Xbox series x , to a mega high end pc build .
And I have lost every single bit of progress I had in every gamr",0
I think its a good game but not all games need to have new stuff all the time.,1
I have a 22 ultra I use for emulation and cloud gaming/streaming my series x. With Wi-Fi 6 and controller plugged in FH5 has been very very playable compared to even a few months ago and I’ve had a blast on the go with rpgs like kh3 etc it’s so very close. We are almost there guys!!,1
If you were concerned about the loss of ownership with regards to software and game pass type services. The streaming game service should terrify you. Streaming service makes sure that only the provider controls your content....,0
Thanks to everyone who sent me this topic and for LIKING THE VIDEO! <3,1
"Let's look at this from a consumer point of view, paying developers a fee for timed exclusive is one thing. No big deal, that's just how the business is. Obviously you need a reason for customers to want to buy your console. But for Sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially BRIBE multiple 3rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay FULL price on there platform instead, because they know they can't compete with it, is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get. And they have the NERVE to call the activition deal harmful to the gaming industry???? 🤨🤨 Talk about the pot calling the kettle black 🤷🏼‍♂️🤣 Sony has no answer to gamepass, there whole business model is about making mass profits out of there customers and making them think they can't go anywhere else. This is simply Sony running scared and trying to limit the damage to the profits they are inevitably going to lose from COD. But I guarantee if Sony were big enough of a company to buy activition themselves they would have done it in a heartbeat, and you bet your bottom dollar they wouldn't leave COD multiplatform. It's apparently one rule for everyone else but completely another for Sony 🤦🤦🤦 hypocrisy at its best",0
Pretty scummy on Sony's part on this one. The game wars are always fair game tactics until you do practices that deliberately sabotage the competition. MS doesn't need the console exclusivity as Game Pass is on PC as well so they just want those subsriptions.,0
I understand if you pay for Exclusive games on your platform then it should not be on your competitor subscription service. But blocking 3rd party multi platform games is shitty.,0
I didn’t even know gamepass had more potential until I learned that they are preventing it from having a lot of games ugh it used to be ridiculous to think that dvd blue ray would stop being a thing when videos went to Netflix Hulu and etc but I think that’s the future of social media anyways just my opinion,0
"IMO what's most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly they're hoping to get out of these deals. Everyone knows that it takes at least 2 parties being in agreement to make a partnership, and most of these 3rd party studios are going to chase money. But then what I have to wonder is if Gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios, then why wouldn't they turn down PS? In theory, Gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties. We've also seen plenty of evidence that Xbox is swimming in Microsoft money, so they should easily have the means to outbid Sony for games they want on their service (as well as typical console exclusives for that matter). Yet, we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to Sony's deals and stipulations. If a studio wanted to join GP and told Sony they would decline their GP restriction contract, I can see them getting less marketing on PS but I highly doubt Sony wouldn't want their sales. Cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with Sony, but I don't know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line. It just seems to me like somehow many studios aren't jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on Gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it. That or GP isn't as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think. (No shade at GP, I love it, just saying I don't get how MS would be losing out to Sony's contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place)",1
Its quite obvious to me that Sony fears Microsoft.  That's why they keep blocking games from going to Xbox. What the heck is wrong with a game coming out to all consoles so that everyone can play? Grow up Sony and mind your own business model and not what someone else is doing .,0
"Im huge xbox fan but honestly there has been barely anything outside 3rd party .. mostly been playing old games but next 2 years from this point has huge potential.. I want to see Avowed already, my most anticipated xbox game. Also forza motorsport will be first ""next gen"" experience on xbox I belive",1
"My favorite xbox series accessorie is the PDP Media Remote. Ive had it for about 6 months and its great especially for the price. Got it for 10$ on sale on amazon and they are i think 20 or 25 now. Worth every penny, unlike the series 2 i bought. Its a great controller as well scince they have fixed some of the reliability issues in the newer ones, however the price is still to much. If your lucky like i was you can find one refurbished for 150$ if thats a risk your willing to take buying refurbished.",1
Ive had an Xbox 360 for 8 yrs it just recently started overheating. It still works but I went straight for the series x.  All access is 37.08 a month for 2 yrs for the console a controller and a 2 yr game pass ultimate subscription.  Ive been running it off my Hotspot. Works great console and cloud gaming. Thank God my internet will be fixed this week.,1
"I really wish they would beef up the storage on the S for it's current price. A 1tb XBOX X is the same price as an S with a 1tb expansion, makes it way less appealing. Granted you end up with a little more storage that way but also less capability in the S. Overall I feel if it wasn't for the whole world collectively crapping itself over the last couple yrs last gen would have already been put out to pasture. As it stands there's not enough current gen owners to pull that trigger yet so games have this half in half out feel. Hopefully production ramps up for PS and XBOX so we can leave last gen behind.",0
"I would say that the best thing about the XBox2 (AKA Series S/X) are the memory cards.  They're convenient & swappable.  With the size that AAA & even some AA games are coming at these days I view them as essential.  With the PS5, I'd have to get, at a bare minimum a 2 TB which ISN'T swappable.",1
If we could just get support for older games to run at higher frame rates and resolutions that would be amazing.,1
It's pretty ridiculous that Microsoft is looking towards upgrading systems especially with it being hard to get the new consoles now. Neither company should be focused on Pro consoles until the Series X and PS5 have been out and have reached their full potential.,0
"I just bought my first Xbox system 3 weeks ago (series s). And their Game Pass is awesome. I've already tried about 15 games and found some games I would have never tried, such as ""As Dusk Falls"" which I enjoyed.",1
"Literally just bought my Series X two days ago and it arrives later this day. I'm genuinely so excited as this seems to be with all the acquisitions and new games being added, it's going to be the decade of the Xbox. Here's to hoping for a bright future!",1
"Can't wait to see an Xbox at best buy, target, or Walmart! Ah' the old days.",1
"I feel you on the cost of the pro series controller. I have one of the series 1 pro controllers (which I bought used) and frankly I was disappointed that after I had been using it a while the rubber on the sides began to warp and peel. I had to buy third party replacement parts to swap out the little plates right there, because Xbox doesn't offer their own replacement parts, which I find kinda lame considering the rubber warping was a fairly common issue. To be honest I would prefer if they had an option to buy it with the plastic plates rather than the rubber ones cause that issue isn't going to go away after using the controller for an extended amount of time. The paddles are nice and all, but I can buy like 3 games for the cost or I can buy a third party controller from S.C.R.U.B. for less and get the same functionality out of it. But hey, to each their own. What I would really love is the ability to make a custom pro controller in their design lab. I would pay extra for that, but as it stands right now, I'll stick with my standard series X controller 🤷",0
"If an Elite Series 3 controller is on the horizon, Microsoft really needs to focus on quality control. I went through 3 Series 2' controllers before giving up and getting a refund. I experienced faulty paddles, loose buzzing rumble motors and worst of all large deadzones on the analog sticks. I really wanted to love it but I couldn't warrant spending that kind of money on a controller with basic functionality issues.",0
Family plan sounds great. Miss the old version we had on 360. Considering I've bought at least 4 consoles per generation. And 4 subscriptions monthly isn't exactly cheap. This is possibly the biggest news of this gen for myself.😁,1
"Matthew, first of all you done a great job with your videos, love them all! Have you seen the recent job offers by BioWare? The next Dragon Age seem in a big trouble and I think it will be great to know your opinion! Best regards from Catalonia!",1
This game should work 140% better based on graphics showcase. Devs nowadays are a joke with optimisations lol,1
Love how you show between both series X and S side by side!,1

"Which game are you most excited for this month, September or even October?! What games are you hoping to see announced?",1
Great games to look forward to in the next couple months. I really wish there were more coop options,1
"Ever since Ubi started putting games on Game Pass Immortals is THE game I've wanted them to drop there, I like the art style over the ultra realistic and the mythology based storyline should be perfect for a classic action adventure experience.",1
Bruh Xbox is Literally kicking Sonys butt with the game pass and I’m loving it 🔥🔥🔥,1
"Plague requiem, high on life and moon scars are the ones I’m soo hyped for. I love gamepass lets go !!",1
"Edith Finch is leaving, wow. That game has been on gamepass since up first launched if I'm not mistaken. I had just figured it would be a permanent title. Great game if you like story and want something you can beat fairly quickly for achievements.",1
Out of all of these the only one I'm looking forward too is high on life looks like I'll be starting my second play through of kingdom come deliverance and if you haven't played it yet and love big open world story driven RPGs with basic survival mechanics and quite different combat mechanics I highly suggest it though it's still got a few bugs,1
"A Plague Tale Requiem, Moonscars, High on Life. Also, don't sleep on Immortals. It is a fantastic game. And even though Im 37 years old, Dreamlight Valley looks great too!",1
Great content keep it up!,1
"Shame Elite is going away.. Just invested about 8 hours this week , got up to a T-9 hauler decked out with A tier FSD .. Just wary about throwing any money at the devs after they pulled the rug out from under console players, discontinuing console development.",0
Quick resume is a game changer. I found myself completely flipping my gaming habits. Jumping between several games in one gaming session. Awesome,1
It's like a superpower the way Linus delivers entertaining and informative commentary so naturally,1
"""this doesn't have ray tracing or anything like that, but the realism from the sun on the screen from my blinds . . . . . Priceless""",1
"Love my series x. I also love my one x too. I honestly didn’t think that there would be much difference. Boy how wrong I was. Loading/downloading times are insane, and quick resume is freaking incredible. So thankful for that bad boy",1
"The One X is still a very relevant console as it does Native 4K on many games, even if it is a stable 30fps. And even some at 60fps, mostly MS titles. Digital Foundry even said graphical differences are very miniscule, and for the most part it would take a magnifying glass to spot the differences. Which is true since I've compared both side by side. When they get MUST HAVE next gen titles ONLY it'll probably be worth it. As of now the One X...AND Pro are just fine. On a 4K display.",1
"Hearing Linus say it's better than a PC in ANY way, you know it's an amazing machine!",1
"I own a series S. Bought it when the X was impossible to find last year and honestly it runs great. Yet to see how next gen gaming truly performs on this thing but I haven't had a single issue with the machine. Load times are waaayy faster than the xbox one s and PS4. Looks great on my 1440p monitor and when upscaling on 4k tv's. Gamepass is great. The hard drive is a bit small for holding s/x optimized games. I use an external for everything else. Stick to performance mode and you will not have any frame rate issues. Lastly, it fits in my backpack if I travel with it. This thing is worth every penny imo.",1
"More like a 5-10% performance boost, which will allow to push the console just a lil more which could make a world of difference for the series s.",1
"More ram being allocated to game devs is nice, but it doesn’t solve one of the biggest issues of the Series S which is the bandwidth of the memory itself. Also more ram doesn’t really mean higher frame rates, but higher quality textures or assets or increase the distance before you see LOD culling. It isn’t going to affect frame rate by going from 30 to 60, but it might allow a stuttering, inconsistent 30 FPS to hold a more locked 30 FPS.",0
I hope they continue to get more put of it in the future as well. We need to finally leave last gen development behind and focus on the Series S as the base for optimization going forward. It's the perfect 1440p console and it pairs perfectly with 1440p monitors at the moment due to 1440p scaling at launch and a decent internal upscale for older content when displayed on a 1440p monitor. You can't touch the value at this price point.,1
Sony did the same with the PS3 cell processor back in the day. The Uncharted sequels looked better than the first one because Developers were granted access to higher memory.,1
"I'm loving my Series S, and this is great to hear. Can't wait to see how far these features  along with the RDNA2 ones, will carry it.",1
"This is so awesome, I travel a ton so I take my *series s* with me because I wouldn't need to take several CD's but I have a small rotation of games I'm able to play. I love this so much.",1
I'm really excited for Hogwarts Legacy as that looks like it could be something both fantastic and fresh.,1
"No love for Pragmata? I’m really looking forward to see more of that game, specially some gameplay since the concept of the only trailer we have is so trippy. I’m personally looking forward for some STALKER 2, Atomic Heart and Pragmata.",1
Man Ryan takes forever to get to the point,0
I’m really hoping for some stalker 2 news,1
Hoping Sony will announce that the PS5 will be back in stock,1
"Finally its you guys, been waiting for you all the week ❤.",1
"PS been dropping at least one exclusive every year since launch so far & I’m hoping to just hear something about these xbox titles

Avowed
Everwild
Fable
Indiana Jones
Perfect Dark
Contraband
Wolfenstien 3
The Evil Within 3

Can’t wait to finally see something from these",1
I’m a little disappointed that Calisto protocol is gonna be cross-gen. It’s understandable because it’s been in development for a while.,0
What I learned from this episode: 1943 was a very important year in MCU history.,1
"We're definitely seeing Blonsky, or Wong for sure in the next episode. I'm so excited!!",1
I love this show. Marvel is on a roll. This is a relatively new character as far as I know. I'm glad that there isn't too much comedy so far. I prefer comedy that is organic in a show like this. I will definitely continue watching.,1
"The way she says ""attorney at law"" reminds me a lot of Allison, from Orphan Black 💜",1
I’m so excited for the next episode.,1
I wish my family could talk like this over family dinner. Discussing MCU theories. Would be a dream come true. ❤️,1
"Imagine a pot-luck between all the MCU super-heroes families.
The kvetching would be epic.",1
"Legit tho I’m happy someone asked about Hawkeye , it’s just amazing , just incredible",1
"I just love Tatiana’s expressions in this , man family dinners",1
"Right!!!

Seeing family dynamics in the MCU's a breath of fresh air since Ms Marvel and family dinners can be a hit or miss. The artwork shown in the pilot really gave us an idea on how episode 2 will play out. Tatiana Maslany's nailing it as She-Hulk/Jennifer Walters.",1
"This is where the show really shines, just let Tat play her character. She's a joy to watch, so fun!",1
What a mood 🤣🤣🤣 Tatiana’s expressions during the conversations,1
"“Does he pick them up when he’s done?”
That’a actually a pretty good question",1

Hope to hear about F4 casting. They’re going to need the two years. They have to complete the cast and complete the writing then shoot then reshoot (as they do) and then get a teaser out months before the release of the film. Heck they announced captain Marvel and Brie Larsen over two years in  advance.,1
"We all knew Marvel was going to save the good announcements for Disney+ day, and D23. 
 Can't wait!",1
"Much in the way they did with Spider-Man, It does help to have Fantastic Four cast early so they can introduce them in other movies and shows. That allows them to introduce the characters and have their audience familiar with them without having to do an(other) origin story for them.",1
"We are just so blessed to be living in a time where there’s so much Marvel content… I’m a huge fan man! Been watching for a while now! I’m very grateful for the shows, movies & everything the MCU has brought us! Thanks for keeping us in the loop as always! You’re the 🐐",1
FF needs an announcement to slowly big that hype with actors and directors for sure.  Thunderbolts is on schedule as much speculation on members and who will be the villain(s) will be.  I do like the idea of the Squadron Supreme / Sinister from another universe as mention in Mr. Roman's previous posts.,1
"I'm stoked for F4 casting. And while yes it's 2 years away, it was also announced in 2019, so they've had 3 years to cast it. And I'm willing to bet they had it cast before Watts left the project. And they may have them cast early so they can pop up in another film before their solo outing. It would make sense for them to show up in Quantumania.",1
Sounds like a pretty solid lineup. I can't imagine them not doing the werewolf by night or guardians holiday special some what. But I guess we'll see.,1
"Super pumped to see who is coming in F4 full steam ahead with everything that's coming in the Thunderbolts, Kang Dynasty, Secret Wars and so much more in the MCU!!!",1
"This is a trailer done correctly, not spoiling anything, yet still pulling our emotions.

Angela Basset is phenomenal, and her line got me right in the feels.",1
"This movie will be epic, definitely break every Marvel record when it drops. Love the cast, soundtrack, outfits, makeup, etc. Wakanda 4eva ! RiP Chadwick 💔💐",1
I got goosebumps after listening to this trailer. This trailer is really good and full of emotions . “I am queen of the most powerful nation in the world and my entire family is gone! Have I not given everything?!” That line and the trailer as a whole sent chills down my spine. Can’t wait to see this !!!,1
"The fact that they included Chadwick's death in the story, and made it a core part of the drama, is a great way for the writers to connect the audience with the movie. We all grief Chadwick, and we are going to see how other people deal with this grief. Hope the move is as majestic as the music from the trailer.",1
"This is not just a teaser, it's a heartfelt tribute to Chadwick Boseman",1
"Chadwick Boseman is the reason we're where we are with this sequel! You rest in peace my friend, you are and always will be our Black Panther. Wakanda Forever! This trailer looks epic!",1
"This trailer is so powerful, if the trailer can bring you to tears just imagine what the movie will do. R.I.P Chadwick Boseman",1
This is potentially going to be one of the greatest movies that Marvel has put forth. This trailer speaks volume and the fact that they did not reveal much is even more fantastic. Dolby AMC Opening Night!? I HAVE MY EYE ON YOU!!!,1
"Since day one when this trailer came out, I cannot stop watching, absolutely phenomenal.",1
"Honestly, i had doubts about this movie and if it should even be made. But this trailer changed my mind. It’s so powerful and this is now one of my most anticipated marvel movies. Definitely one of marvels best trailers ever. The music, the cinematography, and emotion. Incredible",1
"As a woman, I love this video. Something felt so off this phase I couldn’t put my finger on it and you explained it perfectly. Its so insulting for both sexes that what they’re doing is saying that men have to be so stupid and useless in order for women to be strong and smart.",0
"The thing that irks me the most is substituting good storytelling and characters for the sake of filling quotas. I love seeing diversity, it’s a wonderful thing, but it shouldn’t come at the expense of someone else or be shoehorned in for the sake of representation. Just write good stories and good characters, it’s remarkably simple.",0
"It’s always awesome when someone calls you sexist for not liking she hulk. The cgi looks terrible, the marvel humor is painfully unfunny, and I’m getting lectured because of my genitalia but yes, I’m not watching it simply because it has women in it. 

You hit the nail on the head when it comes to representation. Nobody cares about the character’s identity, people only get annoyed when the actors, directors, and studios start sucking themselves off and act like they’re MLKJ’s successor. It’s also annoying cuz they flat out refuse to market minority actors in certain countries then turn around and call you an ist for criticizing their product. 

Same thing with their messages. Sure there are some good messages like choosing love and don’t be racist, but they do a terrible job of conveying them. Also I don’t think a corporation that’s constantly getting accused of discriminating against race, religion, gender, ethnicity, panders to intolerant international consumers, has celebrities attack others for disagreeing with them, does business with oppressive governments, and films at concentrate camps can talk to people about love and tolerance.",0
I’m a huge marvel fan… can’t wait to see each project. This was wonderfully done and beautifully narrated! I was hoping other people were feeling this too… it’s bizarre:(,1
"As an Asian who was actually born and brought up in Asia, I had never felt issues watching Western shows and their ""flawed"" representation. I mean if I want to watch a local movie I would just watch one from my own country, as there is no way Americans can portray my country and my people better than ourselves. This is until I am being lectured about how representation works and how happy I should be watching Americans try to act in various races that totally misrepresented them. I mean seriously, you are telling me your representation of Chinese is representing all the world's Chinese? That is patronizing as hell, because I can tell you there are so many differences between American Chinese, China Chinese and other Chinese living in different parts of the world. Crazy Rich Asians just made me cringe so hard, yes I am from Singapore.

I believe No Way Home would be the last good MCU movie for a long time ever, if not forever. Tried to watch Dr Strange 2, but felt like they killed the original Dr Strange and replaced him with a fake.

If you want a good representation movie in recent times. Try Everything Everywhere All At Once. Great representative movie, not because they checked the boxes but their background is actually part of the story, showing the struggles the characters experienced due to their background, plus the conflict between their cultural background and their current life . I mean they even represented rocks, who else can top it?",0
"When End Game was on the horizon, I remember being legitimately scared that the writers would make Captain Marvel kill Thanos and single handedly stop his army. So thankful they still knew how to write satisfying character arcs for the finale of my favorite franchise. The MCU ended with Endgame and everything since has just been put on the sacrificial alter of Phase 4 feminism.

Though Spider Man NWH was just a one-off great movie for me since Tobey’s spidey was the first movie I remember seeing in theaters.",1
"It sucks how they’ve treated the characters we love so much with such disrespect and replaced them with toxic characters 😔 Spiderman is one of my favorite heroes in marvel and honestly, like you said, these new characters lack any character growth and as such, I don’t feel emotionally attached to them or find them even a little bit relatable or likeable. I just don’t care about these new movies or shows featuring these toxic characters. Also I just discovered your channel and I love your content 🤍",0

"I love that the hero’s got the “hero track” and the villains get Master of Puppets, especially when that riff kicks in is just so much fun",1
This trailer proves there are still directors and writers out there who understand quality and hold themselves to a high standard.  This trailer was awesome!  This is one of the best pieces of footage that I have seen from Marvel in a while.,1
LOOK SO AWESOME! 10/10!,1
This game is definitely giving me Marvel Nemesis vibes and I’m all for it!!!,1
"If they made an entire movie out of this type of quality, I would pay to go see it in theaters.",1
I respect everyone who were involved in this. Seriously the best piece that I've ever seen on YouTube. HATS OFF TO WELL ALL! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!,1
"After seeing good ol' Spidey in this trailer, now I want the game even more.",1
Wow they actually got Yuri Lowenthal to voice Peter in this one too. That was actually very unexpected.,1
"This is awesome, the new design that Marvel give to the armor of Iron man is so cool, the black color is perfect in his armor, also the design of venom is great, and we have ghost rider, i love it. This is a game of marvel that have my attention already.",1
WONG é o maior arroz de festa da Marvel Studios 😂,1
Crazy how Daredevil is getting the same hype as Secret Wars! Shows how much the fans love him.,1
Unbelievable! As a comic book fan I still cannot believe how far Marvel has come along. Thank you Marvel and Disney.,1
"These announcements are bigger than the “Infinity Saga” as a whole. Secret Wars is the singular BIGGEST event in comics. And with this Kang storyline being set up, these next two phases will easily be the best yet. I am incredibly excited to behold what the “Multiverse Saga” will bring.",1
I'm one of those fans that get excited when watching any Marvel movie or series. I love what Disney and Marvel Studios have created. I can't wait to watch all of these,1
"I feel so lucky to be here to witness the birth of not only a new phase but a new saga too. I got into Marvel during Phase 4 and missed out on all of the Infinity Saga hype and seeing all of this for Phase 5 makes me feel so, so, happy, especially with all the joy Marvel has bought me currently. I am literally so ready to witness these movies and shows with others and cannot wait to see what comes in the MCU!",1
I have to say that I couldn't be more pleased to hear the daredevil is going to get a long episodic run. 18 episodes is literally awesome. That is probably my favorite news out of this whole slate release,1
Never in my life did I think I'd see an announcement of a Secret Wars adaptation. Really eager to see the best comic book storyline of all time getting a live action adaptation. 🔥🔥,1
"The fact they’ve given Daredevil 18 episodes is amazing.
I hope they have the writing team from Netflix return.",1
"Hell yeah! Let the multiverse saga begin and I can’t wait to see daredevil, the fantastic four and all new heroes and villains in the MCU it’s gonna be marvelous",1
"Selamat buat Thor, yang menjadi anggota Avenger pertama yang masih layak, mendapatkan film solo ke-4!!! 🔥🔥🔥",1
 -FELICITACIONES- linda festa-. Que QUEENIE.UNO bom que saiu do jeito que você sempre quis ela estava muito linda eeeee aaa mamãe também.*💜,1
"Eres un ídolo LYNELLEE.Uno siempre en mi corazón,hermosa,amorq,elecciones,culturales.❤️ Son unos de los mejores conciertos.",1
I’m so pumped for this movie,1
Film nya bagus baru saya nonton kemarin di bioskop 🥳😘 rangking  99 lagu nya juga bagus,1
amazing lanjutkan bang thor,1
Liat Trailer nya aja udah excited bnget pengen cepet liat film nya 😍 apalagi ada Gorr The God Butcher.. 🔥🔥,1
It will always be an honor to see Wong in every Marvel series or movie.,1
"Appreciate that they went for funny and wacky situations to put a hulk in, rather than pushing the message that she's a strong female character. Gives me slight amounts of hope",1
"Looks like everyone had a blast making this show! That gives me hope, because this is supposed to be a really fun show!",1
Okay 1:04 actually made me laugh and smile. I’m excited for this show and right now it’s the only reason I haven’t cancelled my disney +,1
"I actually really enjoyed this trailer, probably the best out of the previous She Hulk trailers. There are a few things I'm worried about with this show... but it definitely has lots of potential",1
"I love how Wong is starting to pop up everywhere, he's really taking the Sorcerer Supreme job seriously and I'm along for the ride. I was gonna say he deserves his own show (which he totally does) but then I thought ""at this point, the entire MCU IS his show the way he shows up in everything"" 😂",1
I'm looking forward to this and because Tatiana Maslany is so talented! Her 4th wall interaction reminds me of her character/s from Orphan Black. I'll bet this'll be funny :D,1
"I love how Wong is starting to pop up everywhere, he's really taking the Sorcerer Supreme job seriously and I'm along for the ride. I was gonna say he deserves his own show (which he totally does) but then I thought ""at this point, the entire MCU IS his show the way he shows up in everything",1
You know Wong is the most underpaid actor in MCU because they put him in everything,0
Looking forward to this! Tatiana Maslany looks INCREDIBLE in the role! 😃💚💪🏾,1
"""Na minha cultura, a morte não é o fim""✊✊",1
Lágrimas nesse trailer e principalmente na imagem do Chadwick 😢,0
"Esse trailer foi de arrepiar, tá lindo demais!!! Espero do fundo do meu coração que esse filme não decepcione... 🙏",1
Cara que trailer lindo...que trilha fantástica 😭😭👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼...que seja uma grande homenagem a Chadwick ele merece🙌🏻,1
"I will say, the CGI is looking a whole lot better, actually made the show feel more interesting. Props to the teams working on it!",1
This looks really good! And I'm talking about the relationship dynamic between Bruce and Jennifer as well as the VFX. The music goes well too,1
"Wow, that video was amazing! The show looks so fun!! I'm glad they fixed the CGI so that the characters look like they're actually enjoying themselves. I saved almost 90% on my airfare purchases using Mighty 🖖🏾 Travels 🖐🏼 Premium.",1
Love She-Hulk. Seeing her in court should be hilarious but I'm itching to see how well she's going to break the 4th wall. Really hope she points some healthy fun at the Marvel Cinematic Universe.,1
"Ok honestly, the cgi on she hulk looks better than in the teaser. That last shot of her saying “that’s good” looks real. Something she never did before",1
She hulk comics were hands down some of the funniest comics I read as a kid. Decent action but mostly hilarious. If this is a half as funny they'll have a winner!!,1
"I absolutely love the cousin rivalry these two have; Bruce's, ""Little punk"" and Jen's teasing makes me incredibly excited for this! Bruce has been a comfort character of mine for a while, and I can't wait to see him some more, with the addition of a new hero. 

I will say Bruce seems unbelievably upbeat through everything he's been though from his childhood to the end of the infinity saga, but I'm glad to see him less awkward and more confident in himself :)

(I understand this is about introducing Jennifer to the MCU but If we don't get a little of Bruce's backstory, perhaps provoked by Jen making a remark about childhood stuff I will riot! /J )",1
I love that Bruce is learning to cut loose and and not stuck in his stick-in-the-mud ways anymore. That trip to Sakaar certainly did wonders to his self-esteem!,1
"Estoy muy contento de que Daredevil de Charlie Cox esté recibiendo más amor cada vez porque su serie fue increíble, además de hacer un cameo en Spiderman No Way Home que fue genial. Daredevil es uno de mis superhéroes terrestres favoritos de Marvel. Gran trailer.",1
"La escena final del tráiler me dio un feeling a la escena final del tráiler de civil war donde aparece spiderman, por la maroma de ambos héroes, sin duda se vienen grandes cosas para daredevil. ❤️",1
"Que genial volver a ver a Daredevil, ahora tengo más hype por la serie :)",1
"Don't know about the weird glowing power change, but kamala as herself is on point with her personality",1
"I can’t believe I actually enjoyed this show, I mean I kinda had low expectations but it surprisingly was really good and the characters were quite fun to watch so this show really great and quite fun to watch so I’ll give it a 8/10",1
"Just finished watching it today and I absolutely loved it 😍

I love how they included culture in it, I love the humourous scenes and the story telling of Kamala's ancestors 

Very fun and refreshing to watch can't wait to see her again in future MCU projects",1
that show was actually so good! I wasn't expecting much but I ended up LOVING it!!!! Kamala character is amazing!!! <3,1
"i watched it atleast 8 to 10 times literally , it was fantastic hats off to iman vellani and marvel",1
"i loved this comic when i was younger, i can't believe they're actually making a series! super exited and hope she gets the same powers she has usually later on <3",1
I hah watched all the eps and its really great! I loved all the plottwists and everything! I REALLY reccamend to watch it,1
"Absolutely Fantastic Graphics ,Visuals ,effects And Most The Traditional vibe ,Indian Songs😂❤️❤️Unique ...Love from Indian",1
Absolutely diserves blinding lights ever I imagined Ms Marvel would be introduced like this and she is awesome as and the theme is awesome too.... It's made for u Ms Marvel to born in MCU,1
*Simplesmente demais* 😀,1
Mark Bagley is a treasure.  An old school artist from the '90s who still gets work.  God bless him.,1
Glad the artwork is taken a more vintage look and always glad to see Spider-Man debuting again,1
"I love the drawing and spider man new suit, it is like he wear ""anti goblin suit"". And I like Mark drawing of ultimate spider man style.",1
Anyone else getting ultimate Spider-Man vibes from the artwork,1
Cant wait! Love the trailer.,1
"Mark Bagley? The return of the king! Plus, can never go wrong on Dan Slott with Spider-Man.",1
I gotta say bro I wasn’t expecting morlun but now this comic is going to be freaking awesome!!!😎 it’s giving me goosebumps every second.,1
*Spider-Man's is assemble 💥💥💥💥💥*,1
"Esse trailer e acredito que o filme também, é uma grande e linda homenagem ao Chadwick Boseman que infelizmente nos deixou tão cedo, que descanse em paz nosso Rei 🙌🏻",1
Todos nós sabemos que ele sempre será eterno! 😔🖤💜,1
I ended up loving this trailer more than the movie 😭,1
"Thor’s lost his Brother, Sister, Mother, Father, Friends, Warriors Three, The Avengers, Girlfriend, Mjolnir, Home & People. Yet he’s still standing. He’s a true source of inspiration, that’s why I look up to Thor.",1
I love the intro to this trailer so much. It’s only 20 seconds but you think about Thors entire journey in those 20 seconds and how far he has come. Brings me to tears everytime.,1
When they trailer gives you a better feeling than the movie,1
"I still feel kinda bad for Thor, he lost everything because of Thanos, Hela and Malekith. His brother, mother, father and brother friend are all dead.",0
"Just compare this version of Thor from the Thor in the very first Thor movie, truly eye opening how much development he’s had as a character.",1
This trailer felt so promising. Can't believe how daft the actual movie is by comparison.,0
0:54 scene is exactly the same as in the original comic. Movie looks dope already. Love it!,1
"I only play heros that can fly, so while I'm not waiting for her I'll use her when/if she comes out. I'd like to see Falcon though.",1
This gave me full body chills. ❤️,1
"I love how Stan’s “he’s your bother” and “she’s your sister” lines were for two sets of people who were enemies, but made peace with one another.",1
"Even after 6 months, a few movies released and few changes in the slate, THIS... this still feels powerful.",1
*This is why we ❤️ Marvel*,1
"Seeing Spider-Man No Way Home after “Will be worth the wait” hits different now because…
It was… it really was…",1
I bet every marvel fan has got goosebumps atleast once while watching this video,1
"WandaVision, The Falcon And The Winter Soldier and Loki have all been great shows. Definitely some of the best content the MCU has put out.",1
You know it’s good when the scenes in the movies sync with the music,1
Muito feliz em ver a continuação de Shrek e sua esposa! ❤️,1
"Estou adorando ver as colaborações com a Marvel! Me surpreendeu que lu do Magalu estará no filme, parabéns aos envolvidos! 😁",1
Ahh nada melhor do que ver mais um filme com esse CGI super realista 🙂,1
"Só eu imaginei essa interação??

Funcionário 1: poderíamos fazer um modelo 3d, do zero dessa personagem e manter a personalidade destrutiva dela ?? 

Marvel: mas isso custaria muita grana, principalmente para uma série então não... 

Funcionário 2: poderíamos esticar a imagem dela , e botar um filtro de cor verde algo simples sem gastar nada... 

Marvel: Perfect 👌👌👌👌",1
"Com tanto efeito verde ao mesmo tempo e com essa qualidade incrível, já já aparece o Dollynho com uma capa de super heroi! Minha Série 💚💚💚",1
The first trailer had me hyped. This trailer has me ULTRA HYPED.,1
"I really, really loved the movie. I wish it had taken a more serious turn, because I agree with the villain’s perspective and it would have been amazing to see him as a more developed character. 

However, the movie was hilarious and I’ve needed a good laugh. I had a really good time and I think, in the end, that’s what matters to me.",1
"The part where Thor said ""It's thunder time"" and thundered Patrick Bateman really put me to tears. Truly a movie",1
"I don’t know what to say about this movie. It is one of the Marvel movies of all time. The cgi is animated, the characters are written, the story is written, the acting is done and overall, the movie is made. It is a movie. It’s one of the MCU movies of all time.

I like the part where Thor said “It’s thundering time!”, and then he thundered all the bad guys. Truly a movie.",1
"Christian Bale as Gorr looks terrifying. 

Love it",0
"definitivamente supero mis espectativas, muy bueno. Excelente",1
"Gorr was amazing! Just upset the quote ""you are not like the other gods i've killed"" wasnt in the movie. Idk in the trailer it was just smooth af",1
This is without a doubt one of the movies of this year.,1
It's like watching a whole new god of thunder. It doesn't feel like watching Thor because he's so serious and in this he is taken to a joke,0
DON'T FORGET WANDAVISION!! IT NOT ONLY GAVE A BACKGROUND TO THEIR RELATIONSHIP BUT SHOWED THERE WAS LOVE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM!!,1
"let's all be real, Aunt May and Happy are the best couple",1
Scott and hope are the best couple and they're actually realistic but dangerously underrated,1
Vision and Wanda Maximoff are the best MCU couple,1
We can all agree the Romanogers kiss was the best,1
"Un propósito lo es todo. Fuiste el héroe que más perdió en su evolución. Gracias, Thor. Obtendrás el descanso que mereces.",1
Y este bello universo que seguimos hace mas de 10 años sigue mas vivo que nunca ♥ vamos carajo!! por mas del MCU!!,1
"En serio Sweet Child O' Mine le queda perfecto al avance, Love Guns N'Roses 🥀🖤 regresará ha estar de moda, así como Something In The Way de Nirvana en The Batman ❤",1
"Jennifer actually saying, ""Lawyer show!"" straight into the camera is exactly what I want to see in a She-Hulk series.",1
"I will definitely watch this show, it’s different and with all the chaos that ensues in the mcu , it’s nice to have a change. Of course there will still be chaos but not like some avengers level threat…hopefully😂😂!!!",1
This looks amazing! They clearly are making a very entertaining show. Can't wait to see who else the surprise characters are that shows up.,1
This is hilarious. I want the show to have this exact feel to it.,1
I honestly hope that beginning part with the Dun Dun is actually the intro for the  whole series.  Cause that's hilarious,1
"As a Law and Order franchise fan, I appreciate the beginning of this clip",1
"Weirdly enough, this is the trailer that sold me. Seems like an actual breath of fresh air, looking at the MCU from a new angle and if that opening joke is any indication, looks like a fun show. I'm honestly excited now",1
I died at the “dun dun”! Can’t wait for this show to come out!!,1
Super excited !! Going to binge it when final episode comes out 🤩,1
"This was a great stream, it felt like the production quality had gone up a lot since the last Marvel one and everyone played well! I thought Peter was a great addition to the stream - he started a little quiet but really got into it.",1
Love it! Can't wait for this box and also the Wolverine pack! Also can't wait to see what else you guys have in store for the X-MEN saga :)!,1
"We can't wait to get the box and hero packs so we can play the campaign on the channel. X-men my favorite comic franchise, glad to see them come to Champions.",1
Great stream! Really love seeing the passion and enjoyment you all show for the game. It’s also obvious how much you understand the core of characters and continually being that across in your designs. Thanks and keep up the good work!!,1
Great stream! Slim's cards are subtly powerful. Really affected the outcome.,1
Love X-Men! Hopefully they stay around a long long time! This game will now be called X-Men The Card Game as far as I’m concerned. (And if it’s not too late I’d love to see Quentin Quire aka Kid Omega!),1
Unfortunately I wasn’t able to make it live but I do have a question. How do you resolve Shadows of the Past with Phoenix.  It seems a waste to have this restrained/unrestrained status mechanic only to have SOTP say just forget all that,0
Shrek 5 looks great,1
"She Hulk- “im better at controlling my anger because I control my anger infinitely more than you.  I control my anger when im catcalled in the street and when toxic men explain my job to me” 

Do the writers even know Bruce Banner at all? Or do they just look at him as “a man that gets angry and turns green and big”. Because that line of dialogue was ridiculous.  Bruce banner was abused as a kid, watched his father figure beat his mom to death.  Bruce tried to off himself and failed.  Bruce has to live with the fact that Hulk took control of his body and mass killed innocent people in Avengers 2.  

Absolute ridiculous writing.",0
"She Hulk comics were hands down some of the funniest comics I read as a kid. Decent action, but mostly hilarious. If this is half as funny they'll have a winner.",1
"Hulk has fought aliens, monsters, been sent into space, been in battles, taken on Thanos, forced into hiding, had a split personality, and has been hunted and attacked by the military.

But, She-Hulk was sort of cat called by three guys outside a bar, and her boss did some mansplaining early in the episode.  So, her life is (in her words) ""infinitely more stressful"" than real Hulk.

This show is making feminism seem more ridiculous, not less.  Also, Smart Hulk sucks.

- Aaron American",0
I'm so glad I found and watched that video! I miss when movies used to make sense. I'm expecting this series to explain why the Hulk is back in his human form in Shang Chi's end credits. I saved almost 90% on my flights using Mighty 🤧 Travels 🖐️ Premium.,1
It's great to see Hulk jumping again,1
"Love the part where she says ""It's Hulkin Time"" truly one of the shows of the year",1
"I adore Tatiana, she's easily one of the best actors currently working, between her brilliant performances in ""Orphan Black"" or in 2020's ""Perry Mason,"" but my god this looks pretty terrible. Im so bummed for her, because this is the first mainstream exposure she's gotten as an actor, and this looks like it's shaping up to be a complete train-wreck.",0
When you start telling the audience how to feel about the character (see Super Girl E1) you have to doubt they will succeed at _showing_ us a compelling character.,0
My favorite part was Morbius is saved by She-Hulk in the first episode.  Their scene celebrating in the Champaign Room afterward was a comedy goldmine.  He repays her kindness by teaching her the secret of activating full power with Morbin Time!,1
"Me meo con el momento “Jessica Gao”… eres el mejor, tío!!! 🤣",1
"Captain America: *Turns chair around and sits down* So…..you made fun of me, and suffered the consequences.",0
Seeing those flamin' hot Cheetos go to waste was such a heart wrenching moment for me...,0
"This right here is propably the most important thing to make a show or movie like that really work on an emotional level. It grounds even the most fantastic characters and stories  in a way no amount of VFX can: *Casual smalltalk that actually FEELS like smalltalk*  -with all the natural imperfections. 
She even slightly misspoke like we all do from time to time. ( 0:10 ) And they left that in. That takes courage. But it makes even this short clip so much better. I respect that a lot. And I am really looking forward to this show.",1
"“Oh ok so this must be some jerkwad driving like in Doctor Strange-“
*SPACESHIP*
“WHAT THE HELL?!?!?” O-O!!!!",0
"Ok, that got me. I was not expecting that. I thought it would be some kind of a regular car accident, but this is the MCU i guess😂",0
"Se siente diferente cuando ves a Thor sonreír después de Endgame, esto va a ser un peliculón 🔥",1
MENUDO HYPE!,1
"No se si le tengo más ganas a esta o a Doctor Strange 2, que pasada Marvel, aun después de Endgame nos seguís maravillando siempre, viva Marvel!!",1
"Por fin el tráiler!!!
Esta película será epicaaa ⚡❤️",1
"So far, these animated projects look super interesting. I hope Marvel Studios continues investing more animated content in the future, because there are so many different ideas and possibilities that they can do with animation, that would be complicated doing in live-action. There’s should be variety imo. 👍",1
""" I am Groot. That beautifully, poetic quote had me tearing up. Truly inspirational. This will forever be remembered as Marvel histor.",1
"As much as I was excited for What if..? and  X'Men'97 but now that mature rating for Marvel Zombies (which it should) is confirmed, its definitely on the top of my list of series to watch when it comes it...",1
Spider-Man: Freshman Year looks so promising and exciting I really wish it was MCU’s Spider-Man 4! ❤️⚡️,1
I am groot was truly a historic and cultural masterpiece. It is one of the most poetic heartfelt stories ever told. Better than any Shakespeare Play. Truly one of the most historic things to happen this year.,1
I’m most excited for X-men ‘97 from the animated shows. Marvel Zombies sounds cool & I’m looking forward to the gore since it’s got a TV-MA rating.,1
These Animation style's are pretty unique and beautiful! Can't wait to try them out!,1
I love how they made Groot even more cute now back to being Baby Groot,1
Can't wait for all these marvel animated projects.,1
Let there be zombies! That’s the one I was most hype for,1
"Honestly I know this is just a recap, but when the real trailer comes out I can’t wait",1
👍🏻😃,1
Can’t wait,1
Wow,1
Luv luv luv mean bad witches okkkuuuuurrrrr,1
I love this fameplay,1

"No matter how old I get, seeing those portals open in Endgame will always put joy in my heart",1
Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock as a surprise cameo in ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ is also PRICELESS.,1
"Its heartbreaking how sad Strange is, when he says: ""Everyone who knows and loves you..... we.... we will have no memory of you""",0
"The Snap was awesome... but finally getting to hear, ""Avengers! Assemble..."" Was off the chart. It brought home all of the years of wait for an epic payoff. That's my own number one.",1
Avengers endgame itself is speechless,0
"“We can handle your little witch”
Proceeds to get destroyed with ease",0
"I personally love the marvel mech line, and I think Rocket Raccoon will make for a super fun  looking one 😁",1
This set with Morbius is gonna to be one of the lego sets ever made!,1
"My favorite part is when just2good, stepped on a lego morbius set and said, ""Its reviewing time!""",1
"I like that Lego is finally making Morbius as he already had a brief appearance in the Daily Bugle. Also the Rocket mech set could be Groot and Rocket together, but we'll have to wait to see...",1
No but I’m genuinely hyped for the Morbius set 😂😂 Glad it’ll be cheap too!,1
"If you asked me if a morbius set would sell out before the movie was announced, I would say no. I’m excited we’re getting him though, want him to be in a set with spidey and blade.",1
"I get people are meming about Morbius. But he is unironcally a really interesting character, and I love to see how they will design his minifig design",1
NO WAY! I'm in complete disbelief there is a Morbius set. Even if it is most likely comic book based. That's awesome.,1
Can't Believe this year Kass will have a bump and next year a new addition 🥺,1
Ledger in the background jumping was so cute to me and I have no clue why!!! Y’all fam is so pretty!! 💕💕,1
Yessss kass next year you will have a new baby boy or girl to dress up with your family ! I bet it will look so cute! I hope you have a good day or night! By the way I just love your costumes!,1
It’s gonna look amazing! Can’t believe Kass is pregnant!! Love you all so much! Super excited!🤍🤍 I love Halloween,1
"Aww Ledger on the background jumping so cute ❤️ I can’t wait for Kass to have her baby bump has an addition and you guys are soo lucky the kids going to have the best aunts, uncles and grandparents I also loved watching all your reactions on Kass’s channel your such a cute family 🥰 sending lots of love to your family and I hope Kass doesn’t feel sick x",1
I think it would be kinda cool if like everyone had their own colour and dressed up in only their colour or you guys could do something related to the new movie zombies 3!,1
"I think that some great Halloween costumes for big family’s could be Greece the movie, Star Wars, toy story,  Different prisoners, people from the 50s, ghost busters movie-boy/girl, or sea creatures!",1
Omg Kass is gonna have a bump😭 it’s gonna be  so exiting watching you go the journey of your pregnancy!❤️ wishing you the best!,1
I can’t believe Kass is pregnant I’m so happy for y’all!,1

Kevin Feige is CLEARLY more powerful than Thanos or even all the Avengers combined. THAT we can all agree on,1
This has got to be the most emotional panel so far. I wasn’t even there to watch the full thing but I teared up about 3 different times just by watching this,1
"Wow Tenoch’s speech in Spanish hit me. I’m not Mexican, I’m Peruvian, but I understood the message he sent out. You can feel his excitement and that he’s incredibly HONORED to not only represent the Mexican community but Latin America as a whole. I’m looking forward for Namor!",1
"""Last but definitely not least... For the first time on the big screen... Namor the Submariner""

I feel like most people won't really understand how historic that line from Coogler is. Also shows he really understands the depth of the character and I'm so happy for it",1
Man I’m still in awe of how far Marvel has come!,1
"I literally lost it when the black panther artists came to perforn, the cast came on stage, lord m'baku lol & talked about the movie & each individual experience &feelings of honoring this film to their late great brother Chadwick 😢 & to see the trailer b4 hand & watching this panel I cried. This will be epic & another groundbreaking movie at box offices everywhere! Can't wait ✊🏾🖤",1
"This is my first time watching an announcement for upcoming Marvel Movies lmao. These upcoming projects are sick asf, can’t wait to watch these. I’m most excited about the Avengers movies. Hopefully they are as good as Infinity War and End Game. Gonna miss the original 6 Avengers though😭",1
That emotion after they showed the WF trailer was incredible.,1
Hey Marvel fans! Check out this awesome video by our friends at CBR! https://youtu.be/LXe19p_f7JA,1
Chadwick was a legend he will be remembered 😭😭,1
"It also helps the Robert Downey Jr looks JUST LIKE Tony Starks from the comic book, its kinda like he was born to play the part haha",1
Chadwick did more and better while dying of cancer than most actors ever will in their entire careers. He was a true gentleman in every sense of the word. Rest in Power Chadwick 😢❤️,1
"RDJ is an amazing man, to live with a disease that nearly cost him everything and not limited to his actual life. To come back and be one of the best actors and humans I’ve ever watched (from afar as a fan) change his entire life style. 🥰🥰",1
It's finally here. Drop a like if you're hyped to see this suit in the game (even if it's a mod)!,1
This Peter’s model is so perfect for this suit it looks like it’s actually Andrews Peter in the suit unlike the mcu ones,1
"This is one of the best suits in Spider-Man history, and it's a welcome surprise seeing it in Spider-Man: No Way Home when Andrew Garfield was wearing it in the movie. If this suit ever makes it in Spider-Man Remastered officially, it'll be just AMAZING.

Seriously, no pun intended. 😂",1
I'll wait until they are fully finished 😀 don't get me wrong the suit looks good actually but  I needed that movie looking suit with that actual texture and velvety red and blue look with those ballgy glassy eyes,1
"The fact that Insomniacs sound for webswinging is very similar to original TASM2 film, makes it 100% more AWESOME.",1
That suit looks amazing. This suit needs to be put on either spiderman remastered or spiderman 2.,1
"Oh man, hearing TASM2 theme makes me want the suit even more !",1
This just gets me more excited at the thought of a TASM3 movie,1
Andrew's voice in the background music was syncing with spider man in the game. hilarious and perfect.,1
"Literally the best movie suit, but I really do like Tom Hollands far from home suit",1
"Tate after he strangles you
“BREATHE AIR”",0
The screaming when he was strangling him I literally laughed so hard 😂😂,1

Austin is hilarious asf and he's my favorite YouTuber ever 🐐🐐❤️,1

"So how can Darkhold be good in the cosmic room,  room 5? Dr strange should never take a turn according to the passive on the room. I've seen them put in that room before, but it should be like 5 on 4 if you don't bring any cosmic. Can you please confirm this?",0
That score for the Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars Avengers movies gave me serious chills - what a time to be alive.,1
"25 years after Blade saved Marvel, we finally get a reboot. Well deserved and long awaited for sure.",1
The hype is not the same anymore when they announced back in the day phase 2&3 with Infinity War and Endgame. These two if you search the reactions are *INSANE*,0
"The Avengers have always held a special place in my heart.
I’m glad that they’re getting 2 new movies.",1
Seeing the reveal for the 2 Avengers movies sent chills down my spine! I'm absolutely stunned at what all is coming in these next 2 phases,1
Bro that was just insane I can’t wait to see all of these films & shows! 👊🏼,1
"Man I’m so glad I got to witness the MCU in my lifetime, truly something special and unreal.",1
"Even though I wasn't there, I had goosebumps hearing the audience's reaction, and the suspense the screen gave us!",1
"The amount of planning really deserves appreciation. Being a Marvel fan it gives me so much happiness after seeing the Avengers titles. 
But, don't get me wrong, the benchmark the Marvel set with Infinity War and Endgame really seems unmatchable.",1
Cool😮,1
Howdy!🤠,1
If I were that close to Scarlett Johansson I’d have all kinds of trouble with my lines.,0
Iron man is amazing even when he’s not acting like iron man. Robert Downey Jr. for the win!,1
I’d love to get paid millions to just have fun 😂😂😂,1
Ironman saying he loves it when Pepper laughs is just the best,1
Yondu being talked & walked off set was funniest by far...lol,1

Thank you for this video. You’re the first person to point out that Bruce has childhood trauma in his past and Jen doesn’t.,1
"I like how Hulks lab setup is relative to his size, when jen walks next to it, the height of the counter is up to her shoulders.",1
"I was impressed by how more often than not that it actually felt like People interacting onscreen and not CGI Hulk Animations. The montage/action in most CGI scenes I feel use so much motion blur that they're just...well...blurry. There was a bit of that here, but overall it's becoming more naturalistic. Dig it.
Eyes flicker and the uncanny valley is usually from the ""need"" to add every frame between the movements for smoothness, when there isn't much smoothness AT ALL to eye movement. They did a good job with the eyes for sure. 
This has nothing to to with much of what was covered in the video, but just throwing in 2 cents ; - )",1
What is the title of this movie?  Why does the ending of the movie get abruptly cut before completion?  The audience can’t see the message resolution.,0
The movie is so lovely and now part of my collection.,1
So lovely  love to see the next one,1
I'm so happy LMN starting to have black movies with a sprinkling of some of the greats!,1
Very good movie thank you for sharing 💕,1
"So enjoyed watching this film, thank you .............",1
Beautiful family Love this movie...,1
This is really good 😌,1
I'm glad I found this movie because it shows what we can do when we stand together as a people.,1
Great acting for a low budget movie. But also a great message and lesson's we all need to relearn as a society.,1
What an amazing movie... It teach us everything we need to know... Wellll done guys... Greetings from Portugal,1
While this movie is very low budget and not what I thought it was gona be it makes a great point ive been slowly prepping for a while and have one hell of a bugout bag and i advise everybody do the same stock up while you can cause when the SHTF ITS TOO LATE,1
"No its not an A or even a B rate movie.....the core cpl went from being a no nothing not worried about nothing , to analyzing what was going on around the world AT THAT TIME  and starting on a journey that i think many of us have been on for awhile. I will not criticize their reactions , too many people right now are right where they were at the start of this movie. Instead , they started to oopen their eyes and see what possibilitys could happen and took the first steps into prepardness. Im as bad as they are about knowing my neighbers , ill admit that , ive lived in this house 25 years and i only know and talk to 2 of my neighbers...and theres like 20 familys up here withen a mile mabey more. Folks , instead of criticizing this film , analyze it and see where YOU stand and how you can help others.",0
Good movie! Lots to learn to be prepared,1
"For those who think life will never get this way, you best be

This movie is so fkn funny lmao 
I wish we can go back in time

I freaking adore this movie,1
Wow all these deleted scenes make me feel like watching Friday After Next and 1/2,1
This is my favorite one out the entire franchise thank you for sharing this greatness with us🥰,1
"""Don't beat me in front ma kids ...we gon blindfold them "" 😅😅😅😅",0
This better than the real movie 😂😂,1
"🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭🗣️🗣️🗣️ this just made a huge part of my day, finding this movie. Classic",1
You coulda titled this Friday After Next Deleted Scenes and it woulda had the same if not greater effect but watching this made me understand Cubes real vision for the movie and the direction he wanted it to go. I see why he changed some parts but i love seeing this overall🙌🏾!!!,1
I have watched this movie 100+ times and I don't remember half of these scenes 🤣 I know I'm not getting old now,1
"After an hour, I have to say this is one of the BEST movies of the bank heist genre. 👌",1
"This reminds me of when I was a ""Lumberjack"" in the ""Sahara Forest"".

I know it's ""The Sahara Desert"" now. That just shows what a good ""Lumberjack"" I am.",1
"No Clooney, but this is a good movie 🍿",1
Izleyecegiz ! 🇺🇸👏🇹🇷,1
"They shouldn't have a cut scene after the phone ring I'm ready for it to amp up. 36 in and I'm thinking of switching. I like the screen composition the actors and the lack of music. Maybe a few more minutes. 

Edit: it picks up after the flashback. If the flashback was just for a second after Dallas asks the pacing is actually pretty solid.

Mack and Dallas are amazing actors. I love their first scene and Dallas and his wife in the kitchen.",1
"This comment section is a fuckn joke. Besides that the story was amazing! I love how it all played out. Especially since I have committed crimes back when I was a young man. Nothing as extreme as this movie. But enough to end up in jail. I've changed my life around and I never plan on going back to breaking the law. When it comes to watching movies like this man do I get a rush!
Thank you",1
"Eva looks so Beautiful!😍💕💝💕But her role in this Movie 🎥 is envious and jealousy. She didn't want the man when he acted as Blind and then when she knew that he wasn't, then she wanted him. Her evil intentions destroyed their family.",0

It Soo sad but interesting,0

"You hit a soft spot with Ronin.  I think that movie is a masterpiece that went largely unnoticed.  The acting, the dense sub-text, the camera angles, the story progresses while revealing nothing.

Awesome",1
"Penelope is actually a really great movie. My roommate and I love this movie and have watched it many many times. If you haven't seen it you should and I have to say it's a great movie for school age kids to watch because it will teach them a lot of lessons against bullying others, or if you're child is the one being bullied then they will learn a lot about how to love themselves no matter what they look like. And for those parents who criticize your children a lot you can learn a lot about accepting your child for who they are regardless of how you had envisioned your child to be. There's a lot to learn from people of all ages. Watch it!!",1
"Great recommendations list, Darren. Ronin and the car chases, awesome and has a great plot. Silence Of The Lambs; just a superb horror. Agree that Anthony Hopkins is on his finest day, with his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. Just received my latest Universal Yums, from Czech Republic, today 9/23/2021!!! Many thanks for sharing with us and catch you on your next presentation. Take care ⭐️⭐️⭐️",1
"These movie reviews are always good, and largely because they are honest. If a given film is admittedly not the greatest or otherwise flawed,  the reviewer still tries  to point out what might be good or desirable about the movie etc. It's a very democratic approach. Always a good job !",1
"I recently watched ""Hackers"" again and realized that it's a really good pairing with the original ""Tron"". They both present ridiculous representations of how computers work but they are complementary, just from opposite sides of the screen. Great performances from a great cast in both cases. They are solid presentations of how people wished computers worked in the late twentieth century immediately before and after Al Gore opened up the internet to everyone.",1
"One thing that makes or breaks a film is how the filmmaker respects the source material, in this case being The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris. The film respected and captured this incredible book, & the casting of Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins, with Jonathan Demme directing, made it a masterpiece. Some movies you sit and watch.  Others creat a dimensional world you enter completely and that never really leaves you.",1
"While I generally agree with your comments about Ronin, the callous disregard of collateral damage - shooting into crowds and causing violent vehicle accidents - was a total turn-off for me. They spread injury and death among innocent bystanders without any sign of care or compassion.",0
"I just watched Post Mortem on Netflix last night and really liked it.  It's from Norway and has only six episodes in the series.  I'm not sure how I could describe it - horror? (a little); comedy? (a bit); police procedural?  (I guess...some).  It was just really strange and (at least to me), very entertaining.  Also, I watch all foreign movies with sub-titles so I don't know if it's dubbed or not.  Anyway, check it out!",1
"I'm sure you've seen Malevolent from 2018 with Florence Pogue, but if you haven't it's just a really well acted horror flick.  I seem to like just about everything Florence Pogue is in.  Thanks for another great list as I plan to check out Primer and Troll 2, both of which I never would have considered without your recommendation.  Pls keep making as many of these lists as you can!!",1
The Revelation behind this movie is so divine. A great Applause for the Production of this movie.,1
"movie title is ""THE BLACK RIDER:  REVELATION"".  It is an ""After civilization falls survival film"" of fairly good quality.",1
Wow!!! I loved this! Can't wait for the next one!!!,1
"Woo...!,this movie is inspirational most especially the last part where the little girl died I really love that part and there's a great lesson there.
Big thanks to the writer and all who put work to make this movie a success🙏😍💖💥",1
"This is not Black Adam. This is Black Rider. Totally different movie with totally different actors in a totally different timeframe. Black Rider is a good(ish) movie, though.",1
Oh bugger! Can't wait for the sequel. 🤣🤣🤣,1
Dude the rock was good in this movie I ain’t even see him 😂😂😂,1
"I like when they said you got nothing to trade , are you a good fighter 😁😁😁 lol good transition",1
I can’t tell you enough how excited I get every time you release a new video. I’m actually making your infamous stew today ….and probably this chicken Piccata recipe tomorrow 😋,1
"The video was only posted 5 hours ago and I already got off work, went to the grocery store, made it, and am eating it as we speak. And unsurprisingly ITS GOOD!",1
I've been in the mood for chicken piccata for a while so this has just solidified my grocery run for this evening.,1
"What I like about no breading or flour is it's less bits left in the pan to possibly burn --- I could make a nice sangwich with this and the sauce as a dip. 

Hakuna Piccata",1
"The editing is topnotch!! Oh, and the food looks incredible too!",1
Alison!!! 💖🥰 I absolutely love watching your videos. This looks delicious! Definitely a recipe I’ve gotta try. I was looking for a really good chicken piccata recipe and here we are! 😁,1
"I love you, Alison! Can’t wait to make this, this week and I hope it’s okay to call you this, but you are truly my favorite chef!!!!💖💖💖",1
"Thank you so much Alison for sharing with us another of your wonderful recipes, even if they are as classic as a chicken piccata, I really appreciate the personal twists that you give to them! Your twists bring the dishes to a next level!  

I am very sorry for the abuses (micro-aggressions) that you had to endure in your profession. I had no idea what the word ""Chef"", said it in that context, meant. But I know, from my own experience, how even simple words/statements can actually be aggressions towards other people. I have felt that many times in my profession too (which has nothing to do with cooking, btw!).

Lucky us that despite those unfortunate abuses, they did not make you dislike cooking and quit altogether. On the contrary, you persevered in your chosen path and now you are sharing your uniqueness and talent with us. Thanks again.
Never look at yourself through the eyes of the joyless!",1
"wow I'm so proud of lil mama. She did a great job playing this role. It really captures what goes on every day in the hood. I cried, laughed, and my heart was touched. I know so many ppl with similar situations and I am thankful someone is bringing it to light.",1
"This movie really taught me more than I already have known, I'm a young girl trying to start a new life alone after all the trauma I strongly believe that all shall come to end.... This movie also got me a bit emotional too but indeed Is a life teacher, i enjoyed and recommend that it should display movies in different contents cos it's inspirational",1
Lil Mama is so slept on. She is full of talent.,1
Every movie I've ever seen lil Mama in has been so interesting to watch. Her calling is acting. It's evident. I'm rooting for her.,1
OMG LIL MOMMA is SOOOOOO TALENTED AND GORGEOUS ...I hope her acting career takes off she is one of the greatest and they don’t show her enough love this is pure talent and this movie is bomb asf,1
This movie has powerful messages in it. This my first time watching it. Lil mama is a really good actress and rest in peace Traci Braxton,1
Wow this movie was raw...the fact that she lied to majority of the people she spoke to about her kids because she was ashamed says volumes. This was wayyyyy too good for free on YouTube but I'm glad it was.,1
This little girl brought tears to my eyes. She’s so smart. Lil MaMa is the truth all around !,1
So sad I cried 😭😭 she looks just like my daughter I would never take her through the bullshit I went through 🙏 I love this movie,1
Great movie!! I cried at the end. Praying for all the young girls who may be going through something like this!! Keep your head up! Better days are coming 🙏🏾🙏🏾,1

JW4  is gonna be EPIC. Ive the feeling that its going to be one of the best action films of the decade,1

About time Stallone played the old tired hero, other than reprising an old hero!
I hope him every success.",1

I'm 37 and i shamlessly tell you i'm more eager to see pus in boots than i have been to see everything that came out after endgame,1
I've seen this a dozen times.  The opening does a great job of setting the scene of absolute loneliness in that town.  You feel the sadness along with some of the characters.  A longing for times passed.  A stirring for something new.  Damn good movie.,1
I first watched this with my grandfather and many times after. He’s gone now and this movie means even more to me now then when I was younger….thank you from the bottom of my heart,1
"Robert Duval, tem meu respeito e admiração eterna 🙏👏👏👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼",1
The best western mini series ever.  What a stellar cast!,1
I was 12 or so when this aired on 📺. This was the only show I can think of that had my whole family piled up together watching. Even my workaholic father stayed up to watch this. Damn…. That was a beautiful time in life!!,1
This isn't just a western. It's a documentary based on Goodnight and Loving and their trail drives. But absolutely classic of classics. Duvall said it was his favorite film to play in.,1
Lonesome Dove is to Westerns as Saving Private Ryan is to War Movies. It stands alone as the very best of the best.,1
Thanks for the movie,1
Worthless movie and screwed up sound track ..... Don't even try,0

Great film Great actors and great entertainment. You don't see much quality films like this anymore.,1

"The goose caught my eye. My brother had similar altercations with a goose when he was a toddler. Love the movie. Love the story. Love the musicologist and the organium. 
Applicable story for these times. I thank the for this that thou hast presented.",1
I gotta tell you Gary Cooper never lets me down. Another great movie,1
Sou fã dos filmes 🎥 de faroestes USA desde a minha infância hoje tenho 76 anos . Mas poderia serem legendado em português todos eles aqui para o Brasil por favor. Muito obrigado 😊 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏👏👋,1
One of the greatest films of all time with a timeless message.,1
One of the first films we saw as a family at the drive-in when I was 7! What memories. And to think American people were so lovely back then. That was a nation worth fighting to preserve!,1
I love old movies about the history of America & how it touched people's lives ! Teaches us life lessons !🥰,1
I miss seeing these good wholesome family movies . Ones the entire family could watch and enjoy.,1
"Logan all I can say is thank you. Thank you for being consistent for more than 15 years and always thinking about the fans. This video is going to be truly the end of something and we all know it's going to be amazing because everything you post is. You have kept us entertained throughout so much. I've been watching your videos for over 7 years and it hasn't gotten old. I think you have truly built something special, and for that, I can only thank you.",1
"This was literally the best SML in years, and there have been literally nothing but bangers for the last few years. Keep up the AWESOME work guys!",1
"Now this, this is a true masterpiece. I can't believe how much effort you guys put in this video!! Best episode ever tbh. I love what you guys are doing, keep going!!",1
"This was by far the most emotional, action filled SML video you guys have ever made, amazing work to all of you!!! Keep making amazing stuff!!!",1
I haven't watched SML in years. This actually got a chuckle out of me. Props to all of you guys!,1
I just can’t explain how much I love this episode!  I started watching sml when I was 8 and last week was my birthday!  6 entire years of sml.  Thank you guys so much,1
6 years of waiting for this episode and they knocked it out of the park Logan and the SML crew you should all be proud I've been watching your channel for almost 8 years now and you never stop making me laugh and making my bad days into good days,1
Been watching for 11 years!! What a ride it’s been since MALSADA. I appreciate everything you do Logan. The crew’s creativity really pops in this one!!,1
"We’re almost at 4 Million Subscribers on this channel! Even if your old channel got 9 Million, this is your fastest growing channel and is well deserved. This is the best video of the year hands down and it’s crazy thinking about how much effort was put into this. Congratulations on all you’ve achieved on YouTube and will continue to achieve in the future. Thank you for this amazing video.",1

From starting to ending good movie 🎥,1
Enjoyed this movie..❤,1
I normally do not like LONG intros (and 9 minutes is EXTREMELY LONG)...but this is great... if the rest of the movie is this good.... wow!,1
In real life i respect and felt proud to every woman who learned self defense. It's took me 3 years to learned self defense .. it's a must ladies ✌🏻🤗👍🏻👍🏻,1
I entertained so much. Nice movie ❤️,1

"The first singer's voice was glorious-- and what a lovely, authentic soul. I loved him.",1
I really think the lady who sang the song from the greatest show man movie deserves an award. She have the voice of an angel. I hope and pray she will make it in the music industry! Best wishes!,1
"The first man is definitely, Golden Buzzer!!!!  What a voice!",1
"I have watched Sarah Ikumu's performance of ""And I Am Telling You"" who knows how many times now, and she blows me away EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Just spectacular!",1
The girl who sang Never enough was showing her true self as she sang. Loved it in the movie and even more this time.,1
"'Yesterday' Jimmy spent his time teaching online kids' music. Remarkably he sang ""Tomorrow""  not knowing that 'Today' on this vry day marks the greatest day of his life. He deserves the golden buzzer👏",1
"Simon: ""You should sing something else""
Simon: ""That's not my worst song anymore!"" Jimmy is amazing!!! That voice is outstanding!!!! I don't know how he did that!!!!!",1
The 15 year old was a superstar already. Such an extraordinary voice. Thumbs up! 👍🏼,1
"Immortal Classics! I am now 71 and saw this classic during my teens on the big screen! Am still a big fan of Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn and Elly Wallace! Rest in Peace my teenage heroes!!!",1
This movie has a special place in my heart.  I was with my father who was dying of AIDS and we watched it together the night before he died the next day.  I remember us enjoying it together in the evening and he slipped into a coma that night and passed away the next day.  Every time I watch this great film I remember him!,1
"The Magnificent Seven, over time, has come to describe the lead actors more than the movie. And the most  magnificent of the seven ... Yul Brynner. Impossible to match him.",1
Possibly not only the greatest film ever made but the greatest story. The lesson being that material possession should never take prescendence over our common humanity. 'A dollar bill always looks as big as a bedspread'. What a line!,1
I saw this movie in seventies as a teenager several times. They were all so larger than life heroes. There can never be another Magnificent Seven.,1
"Even though the movie is a remake, it's one of all time greats. Sure, some plot twists are naive, and the fighting/effects don't stand to contemporary cinematography, but everything else is simply brilliant, starting with the original score, all the way to the moral lessons the movie brings. A true inspiring masterpiece.",1
"I first watched this movie in a cinema in 1960s . The righteousness, truthfulness, bravery and courage shown in the characters in the movie helped to mold my character in the later days of my youth and made me join the uniformed service to serve the public.",1
"One of the greatest western movies that were ever produced.
Mostly all of those who played out their lives on the silver screen have passed away.
I've seen this movie around fifty times and NEVER tire from watching it.",1
"I love this movie, thank you.",1
"Good movie,thank you for uploading it.God bless.",1
Love it ❤,1
"It is actually so tough to even imagine the vedha character other than vijay sethupathy, but Hrithik is extremely talented... So hoping the best to see this vedha🤩",1
"It's true that no One Can Replace Vijay Sethupati Vedha Role but Hrithik has also done justice to the role 
It will be the Biggest Blockbuster Of 2022 ❤",1
"That Tada Dada Dada Da Tada Dada Dada Da🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 gives me goosebumps 😌😎🔥🔥

*This will be blockbuster ❤️*",1
Waiting we are kerala teams we love vikram vedha tamil movie madhav sir and vijay sethuparhi sir now waiting this combination  heavy team,1
"No one can replace Vijay setupathy as Vedha role.But I'm sure Hrithik has delivered his masterful performance in this movie, total goosebumps with bgm👌🔥",1
Hrithik always amaze us with his acting skills.,1
but seriously guys believe me this movie is gonna be a super hit this year no comparision.,1
I completely agree with you about Thirteen Lives! I watched it the other night and I wasn't sure I was going to make it to the end. It was so intense and I felt so claustrophobic and almost panicky at times watching it. Unbelievably fantastic movie!,1
"I wish someone would come up with a streaming service that includes a lot of movies from the 40s and 50s without having to pay extra for them. I'm a big fan of classics including the likes of Cary Grant, Kate Hepburn, William Powell, etc. I used to be able to watch them on YouTube, but they've pretty much all been pulled because of copyright infringement.",0
Thirteen Lives was incredible. It's exactly how we as human should be behaving.,1
"I really liked Bound! It shows even if you have a small budget you can still make a really good movie. 13 Lives was good also. I watched Marathon Man when I was too young to get into it or understand it, I recently watched it on Prime.",1
You could not have been more spot on with Thirteen Lives Darren. What an amazing film! Incredible. Thank you as always for the recommendations.,1
I always appreciate the work you put into your reviews. I feel that you’re very thorough and honest in your opinion. Thank you for what you do. JCVD is an amazing movie. Very hidden gem.,1
"Another killer list! I've said it before, but check out Birdy for one of Nicolas Cage's earliest movies, and 'Hector and the Search for Happiness'. Both are terrific movies.",1
"13 lives was an excellent movie! I remember hearing the situation on the news. I didn't realize how long those kids were trapped and what had to be done to get them out. 
Drowning/ suffocating is a fear of mine so seeing this had me on the edge of my seat anxious as fuck but it was worth it.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND  this movie.  It was so so good.  Great even.👍👍👍👍👍",1
"I have watched Vikram vedha on youtube in Hindi last year. I don't think, Saif can beat R. Madhwan in acting. R Madhwan surprised us in the end as he looks innocent throughout the whole movie. But Saif doesn't look innocent at all throughout the trailer. R Madhwan's smile was enough to make Vikram vedha a thriller movie.",1
Vijay sethupathi is one of the most talented actor I have seen in south industry n r Madhavan is one of the most underrated actor love the original masterpiece❤️,1
Krk reviews should be released in theatres all reviews one after another for 3 hours it will become blockbuster 😂,1
"Sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on Theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25+ Crores for a movie. Even highly educated Proffesionals (CA's, Engineers, Doctors, Civil Servants etc) do not earn this kind of money in India after 10 year of service. 

A simple logic, if theses actors (Including the Kumars, Khan's, Devgans, Kapoor's, Roshans, etc) start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie,  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price.

These Superstars have built their mansions worth 100+ Crores and secured the life's of their children and grandchildren. They are living king-size life with our hard earned money. I believe we better stick to OTT or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on YouTube or any other app",0
"I always wonder, why his videos are never in trending. They are so hilarious yet to the point.",1
Everyone is busy praising this movie.....but I prefer the original anytime....no comparison there.😂😂😂😂But your reviews are as usual hilarious.,1
"3:13 hilarious review 😅🤣😂😅
I am Pakistani and I always wait for KRK videos, by God big fan KRK bro
I watch your videos everyday because you always made my day with your incredible review, also I'd say KRK's viewer doing unfair with him because he deserves like similar to views, everyone must like his videos because he is doing hard working for us and he always keep us updated about bollywood activities and news, so he deserves for views, like and followers.
Love from Lahore, Pakistan",1
Vijay sir is gem 💎 and true legend 🔥 Bollywood can't match it even hritik can't,1
"Great cast and 📽️, the curse words in it though,,?! Karuru Kev from Limuru_Kenya. Tis Al 'curse words' up!!!",1
The dinosaurs wowed audiences for 150 million years. Jurassic Park went from brilliance to boredom in just 30.,1
The only one that legitimately peaked my interest was that Vesper one.,1
"I'm going to watch "" Indiana Jones and the batcave of spiderman,"" when it comes out.",1
WOW!  I could really miss every single one of these and not feel I'd missed a single thing! 🤣,1
"I loved the first avatar movie, thought it was amazing, couldn't wait for the next movie. Then 13 years went by. It's like your dad finally came back after he went to go get milk that one day when you were a kid and now you're an adult and he asks if you want to play catch in the yard. Confused, surprised and filled with a decade and a half of resentment, you're like ""yeah sure, I just gotta go get some milk first""",1
"8:47
I mean, I like how they're going into the nuance of Black Adam. The anti-heroes in the DC and Marvel universes are as numerous as the heroes and villains.",1
"Its just the Music and the Visuals in Avatar that gets me everytime, i will definetly watch it in Theatre just for the goosebumps.",1
"I cried like a baby through this entire film. A biblical story brought to life with such brilliant actresses and actors.  Started watching this movie about 9:45 in the morning. I never have time for anything else, especially movie watching, but it captivated me and I decided I'll watch it out and then get moving. Didn't even wanna move a beat until the end. It's worth the watch. Get your hearts warmed and the tissues out. Smiles! Ruth was deserving of all her flowers. I fell in love with this actress since Tyler  introduced her in ""Why did I get married?"" Naomi, Loretta Divine was perfect for this roll. Love love this movie. Again watch it.",1
What a God bless movie. From the story to line to the Characters. Absolutely beautiful !!,1
Thank you for sharing this movie.  This was a wonderful remake of the biblical story of Ruth and Naomi.  I wish for more movies like this.,1
"This movie has taught and shown me so much, how to have faith and trust in the Lord with all my heart. I will be still because the Lord of host is with me in Jesus name 🙏🏽",1
Very inspirational...thanks to the  makers of this movie for bringing life with current actors/actresses to an old love story from the bible....well done,1
"I watch this movie 3 times in one day...omg this was beautiful....they did an awesome job acting the biblical story 
Am glad that i watch this",1
Absolutely Amazing movie...Love it...Wonderful job to all the Actors and Actresses...💝💙💞🧡💛💕💜💖...,1
I thought it was only me crying thru the movie. Great one I loved it 🥰,1
Loved this movie and the actors ❤❤❤,1
Thank you for sharing this movie it was so good and entertaining again very good movie ❤️,1
"A Writer's Odyssey is very original and entertaining. It has flaws, but it's wildly imaginative. Fantasy? Sci-Fi?  Pure action epic?  It's hard to say what genre it belongs to.  But it's certainly not the usual Hollywood remake or evil a Marvel creation.  I saw it and was pretty impressed.  I can actually see Hollywood doing a remake on it because its story is so original and amazing.",1
would be great to see a movie starring tom holland and taron egerton as a buddy team up action comedy...doesnt matter if theyre cops or robbers i just think they could have some great chemistry and action potential given their athletic skill,1
"As an avid fan of the original Sonic games back in my childhood, I'm pretty stoked to see the new film",1
Lustereczko powiedz przecież kto jest bezpieczny w tym świecie? 😍,1
"So many of these look really good, I can't wait to see them, even the Sonic movie. Its feels a long time since we have had quality movies and TV to watch. I hope they are offered online soon.",1
"Northman is my fave out of this list... Coming from a Vikings, Valhalla and Last Kingdom fan.",1
Top freaking Gun!!Can’t wait! I just wish they had done this sooner so Val could have really been a part of it! Glad to see homage done though 💞,1
"Saw Sonic 2 on Saturday! Even though I saw a Bunch of Spoilers, it was REALLY GOOD! Can’t wait for the Third One! And I’m seeing Doctor Strange the weekend AFTER It Releases",1
"Top Gun, Jurassic, Dr. Strange and The Northman, Everything everywhere all at once was a kind mind trip loved it",1
Iceman made Cornell! Sweet. Can't wait to see uncharted but I was really hoping for somebody else playing the main character.,1
"Kirk was the real deal.  Born in 1916, died in 2020 at 104 years old. Had an amazing career.",1
"Two of my all time favorites, so very funny.  You know it's good when you don't want the movie to end.",1
"So good to be able to witness great acting by two legends, thanks.",1
A really magnificent movie. And a awesome cast of actors. I haven't seen this movie in years  . And it's just as good today as it was then .,1
So good to see these two great actors in this in their aged years.  Really good film I hadn’t seen before. Thanks!  Kirk Douglas still rode a horse good!!,1
"Don't know how the hell I missed seeing this one,  loved it !!!!  Two of my favorite actor's.",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed Kyla Pratt in this movie!  She's natural in a comedic role. People need to recognize she's a grown woman, with kids, and learn to separate her from Disney so she can portray more adult-content roles. . . I felt she tastefully did so in the scene, where she was  referencing, ""Eating her cake.""
Kyla, go 'head, do your thang!
CELESTE, in the ATL 🌻",1
Good movie 🎥🍿🍿,1
Good movie🎥,1
Who the hell is making these kind of crappy movies?,0
They are alive in our hearts ♥️,1
"The reality of ""resurrection"" is portrayed in this movie. My most favorite Indian cinema superstar Pran, the theatrical scholar, draws audience in a manner as they see the story unfolding right before their eyes. He was indeed one of the best cinema stars. RIP.",1
Two legends in one movie ❤️,1
"Dil ko chune wali movis 
90 ki film bahut achi hai❤️
Our singer ki behtrin aawaj 👍🏻",1
Keerthy is a decent actress.i saw her many movies she took decent role how many of U accept this,1
Siva karthikeyan is one of my favorite actor ....❤️️ i have been seen his every films .... he is also one of the actor who don't have arrogance 😍❤️️.....luv him a lot and a lot,1
Rajinimurugan is the only Sivakarthikeyan movie you can watch anytime without getting bored,1
I don't know Tamil but I am understanding the story by reading subtitles..obviously Tamil movies are very good and awesome when it roled by my favourite actress😍😍😍,1
This is my favorite movie of all times. Siva Anna was amazing...I loved this. I watched this movie many times...and I never will get bored watching this movie. Super..👍👍,1
SKN and SOORY is good pair in all movies together... 😍👍,1
I love this movie a lot. I can't sleep without hearing rajinimurugan songs. I am a big fan of sivakarthikayan and keerthi suresh.,1
Shilpa Shetty was amazing in this film. Her typical Koli accent and that bindaas attitude. She rocked her role. Very underrated performance.,1
Shilpa was absolutely hilarious in this film. Outstanding performance. Lolo had the best drama but Shilpa had hilarious comedy. Great balance.,1
"Literally  ... one of the best movie of bollywood...
How bollywood was used to be...🥺",1
Taking me back to 90s where the movies were so aesthetically beautiful ~ those were the days where everything was blissful.🧡💙💜🌻🦋,1
Shilpa Shetty's Acting was phenomenal! Her role had comic flair with emotional strength.,1
"The emotion, concept and every actor's performance of this movie incomparable... Watched it for the first time when was too young.. Probably when I was in grad 3......but still thrilles my soul... Wow...wow... Wow..... Hatts Off to the makers.... But I must appreciate the performance of Anil kapoor who has really expressed the immense and unlimited love and passion of a father for his son and Shilpa shetty who for me has been a kind of an angel in this movie......Loved her performance the most...",1
"I can't stop crying😭
 this film is so emotional😭
Still watching Dec 14 2021",1
What a beautiful sad movie .. 😊I really love the scene playing violin ..,1
These older movies really know how to pull on the heart strings. Damn I'm a sucker for emotion. Great acting.,1
"Enjoy more exciting Movie, Drama and Original in one place, Bongo! Visit: https://tu.bongobd.com/Watch-LiveTv-Movie-Drama",1
That video was amazing! I'm not sure if I'm watching a new Mission Impossible movie or a re-run of Uncharted. I was able to travel to multiple countries in a year thanks to the great deals I got with Mighty 🖖🏽 Travels 😘 Premium.,1
"As the trailer started for Avatar, my first thought was ""NO! Let the last airbender movies die peacefully!""
Then seeing it was the next James Cameron Avatar, I was immediately relieved.",1
"When I saw the first Avatar, I commented to my wife that there was no water creatures. As a former sub sailor, I am really looking forward to The Way of Water.",1
I'd love to see a mission impossible/James bond cross over mover. Ethan and James together. That would be epic,1
Do you ever feel like there are so many great upcoming movies but they just disappear,0
Mission Impossible movies are for fans and there's a lot of us. You had to be there...I love movies so I'll watch them all!,1
CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 7 🔥🔥,1
AVATAR looks incredible..  Bullettrain looks alright. Brad Pitt is a great comedy actor😄,1
and that is why mission impossible does so well in the box office. Great marketing and well in advance. Also the box office lives for movies like theirs. You can just smell the popcorn while watching their commercial.,1
Mission Impossible movies just getter by time! Can't wait for this one!,1
"*There are no words to describe my feelings right now. Congratulations, this video is really good 💝.*",1
Now this is what a movie is supposed to be like. John and Vidyut sir just made magic on the screen. With Vidyut sir being a perfect villain and John sir being a perfect cop on the hunt.,1

23:23  Joonie: ''Cooler''
23:23  Yoongi: ''Butter''

23:23  Alfiora: ''Preety''
23:23  Alana: ''Awesome''

23:23 Son unos de los mejores conciertos, no puede ir pero de tan solo verlos desde pantalla, se que estuvo sorprendente 🖤.",1
"2011, when this movie released Vidyut became the nationwide crush . Dhoom 1 for John & Force for Vidyut. No one can replace them in these two movies❤❤❤",1
"One of the better “expert rates” videos I’ve seen. As a former tanker, it’s cool seeing tanks getting some attention!",1
"Love this guy!  Roofs are not ""usually"" designed to hold 40 ton tanks.  This implies that there are roofs designed to hold tanks.",1
"One of the best ""expert videos"" I've seen. This guy is not just very knowledgeable, but also a very good communicator, and even an entertaining and enjoyable person. I can easily imagine this guy being loved at his job.",1
"I am a member of the German army reconnaissance forces (which use the Spähwagen Fennek) and we sometimes actually call our car the batmobile.

Also, we still very much work with Auftragstaktik, most likely more than any army in the world.",1
"""Unexpected Chieftain is the best Chieftain""  Great guy, great channel, great knowledge.  So glad to see him on this episode.",1
"This was immensely enjoyable, we need more with Loremaster Moran!",1
"The main problem with the tiger scene in fury is that decision making. Although independent thinking was encouraged in the German army, the choice here to take the tiger out of cover and engage on the move is a miserable decision on the commanders behalf. The tiger had no gyroscopic turret so would be very inaccurate whilst moving. He also has the ability to kill all of those Shermans through their front armour at that range and can’t even be sure they know his exact position. Essentially, the commander is a tool.",0
In fury it infuriated me that the German tank decided to blow his cover and close the distance with the Shermans. The tiger had an amazing advantage but blew it all away,0
I'm trying so hard not to get too upset with most of these kids and their complete disrespect for some of these masterpieces at first glance because I know every generation goes through this stage. It's like an infuriating rite of passage.,0
"Janelle and Lucas made this video an awful watch, their attitude to something they’ve never seen before is unbearable",0
The disrespect these kids had for pagemaster and the iron giant is crazy smh,0
Balto is a legend. His statue in Central Park proves it. He raced the entire length of the last two stops on the modern ididorod without help to get medication for a pandemic that hit Alaska. He ran in a blizzard for 8 hours without rest just to give kids children a chance to survive. A true legend.,1
"It’s not so much the fact that they don’t know these movies that makes me mad, it’s the disrespect they are showing towards the animation that gets me mad! 

People worked hard to draw those films, hand drawn animation and cell animation was tough compared to now with computer drawn animation, and a lot of the animation on these movies still hold up.",0
"As always, Jaxon and Anthony are so funny together by just being competitive. 
Jayka and Danny have good chemistry, too.

One of the reactors though was too snobbish against these classics. Wait till you become older and realize that some shows this decade would be considered cringe in the future, too.",1
"I get not knowing these movies if you literally never heard of them. I get not liking the quality. But Janelle and Lucas’ entire personality throughout this video is “let’s trash everything we see and devalue every credible thing about it.”

“bUt tHEyRe tEEns” No. the other teens in this video were great and open minded. Other teens in real life are very open minded as well. These two don’t pass the vibe and I wouldn’t want to watch anything old with them.",0
"I’m Gen Z and this is just embarrassing, I knew every single one of these",0
"Great seeing so many old friends in Thai movie that is getting international notice. 
Good luck pee Thepp and all the other guys involved. 
Mr. John (Tahmaan)",1
"Great video! As an established data scientist myself, this is definitely an accurate data science project lifecycle; however, I almost never go through all of these steps in the same day. You can spend whole days just cleaning data, tuning models, or putting things into production. The work that you do can also vary by company, some data scientists only work on part of that lifecycle just doing exploration and modeling or modeling and productionization. I have a few videos on my channel that complement this one nicely for those interested!",1
"it was a great overview of all the process.  it would be great if we get more videos on DATA PREPARATION, EDA. various methods
for different scenarios.",1
"Great video. You did great explaining this. That said, I would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps. Specifically data acquisition and cleaning. Mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research. Furthermore, it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found. Do some field work, say NSF or an FFRDC gives you 2 million dollars for it. Go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you don’t figure out until your back? Oh well. This seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies. All the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now? Now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned! THE FIRST TWO STEPS (ACQUISITION AND CLEANING) ARE SO IMPORTANT!!!!!",1
"Thank you for this super interesting video! :)
I would like to ask you something: Which are the most important skills that a data analyst should have/learn?",1
"A nice capture of the top level elements, thank you! It easily gets convoluted, and I was looking reflect on a simple overview.",1
"#Simplilearn
You are amazing !! Thanks for teaching us a big chunk of knowledge within a couple of minutes !!!
Now I'm much interested to become Data Scientist.",1
Data science explained in such a clean and brilliant manner!! Thank you for the awesome video!!,1
"This is really a very clear presentation of what really goes with a data science project from the very beginning. However, things do not happen very easily. There are a lot of challenges that you have to deal with. In data cleaning alone, the time that you use can be overwhelming.",0
Your videos are what is getting me the necessary introduction to data science. Thank you so much!,1
"Thank you, nicely explained.

Where does Adaptive analytics stand which doesnt require historical data?",1
It was so good 😌 ...will you do a video on machine learning product and machine learning in production environment. At last machine learning engineering and MLops,1
It was a perfect explanation! Thank you!,1
A complete explanation with good details thanks 👍,1
Please make another more videos on machine learning also.,1
I would be interested in a video on data science machine learning.,1
It was good explanation..Thank you,1
Thanks a lot :),1
"Thank You so much 👌🏻👍🏻

"I love her teaching style...I'm gonna finish this in 2 days, it's so good and easy to learn...wasted 6 months in college learning this and they taught in much detail in 10 hours... it's amazing.",1
The course was great . I liked this . Could u please also make python full course but not beginner level but with a life examples. Would be so appreciative of that.  👍,1
"First of all, thank U so much Edureka for helping me out in my studies. It was such an amazing video. ❤ Secondly, want to know why U don't have any link to the power point of the lecture. Personally it's very difficult for me to write down everything and make notes. Could U plz share the PPP as well ? 🙏🙏🙏🌷🌷🌷",1
2 hours.... continuously watching it and hopefully going to complete in 1-2 days only. Already in love with it. 😍 Very intuitive teaching.  Thanks for providing this knowledge for free.,1
Amo esses cursos! Vocês são awesome!!!!!! Muito obrigada! Greetings from Brazil =),1
Thank you Edureka for this wonderful course. From where can we get the datasets used in this course? It would be great if you could share them through a link.,1
"This is my first time in data science. I've listened to thousands of lectures in my life. Barton Poulson explains it very well, in a very understandable and motivating way. Thank you very much to him. I recommend to those who want to take this course.",1
I am only 2 hours in but I LOVE the way you demystify what I once thought was so out of my league/ability and perhaps interest as well.  Thank you so much!!!,1
"2:12:19 so far and cannot imagine how much effort these guys have put to make this. This is really a beautiful attempt. This is great. Thank you, FCC.",1
I have gone through the whole video and am really grateful for the time you've invested in this. The vivid pictures and friendly speaking pace were truly refreshing and helped balance the ubiquity of the text. Cheers from Abidjan!,1
"For me as a layman, this is the best introduction in the topic I've found so far. A video that I can always come back to and rely back on for a solid foundation.",1
Barely 10 minutes in and can already appreciate the time and consideration put into this video. Thanks so much.,1
"Great course! Content is informative, well structured, and explained clearly. It is evident that Barton Poulson is very knowledgeable and his personality really shows through. His spirit is encouraging and I thoroughly enjoyed his humour. Keep up the inspiring work!",1
"This is excellent even for people already working in related fields because it talks about many tools and concepts they may have overlooked. The organization, clarity, and Paulson's breadth of knowledge are impressive!",1
1:05:41 so far it's the best and most clearly explained video on data science I've watched so far. Awesome job.,1
"As a current college student, I really appreciate the breakdown of the different roles and responsibilities for Data Science. Keep up the good work and I would love to learn more about DS.",1
these are what i watch when im depressed about my career at 1am,0
"I wish I saw this 6 months ago! I've been trying to transition careers from physics to ""data science"" and after not having much luck despite what I thought to be very similar methods used in my former career, now its becoming clear why my resume is getting nowhere... I've focused on the top too much, haven't showcased my whole pyramid.  Thank you bro!",0
“What tools do you use... we don’t care” <- most relevant comment I’ve seen on a data science video. Great video!,1
"I'm a college student wanting to explore this field. You're been a great help. I'd love to watch ur videos on the breakdown of the buzzwords...ml, ai, deep learning, neural networks etc... btw loved the video.",1
"I've been interested in the term ""data science"" and what it could mean for me, my hobbies and career, and your video has been a brilliant introduction. Thank you!",1
"Such a concise, easy to understand, and thorough explanation you've got there. It can be understood clearly by someone like me, with no prior knowledge of what data science is and what it entails. Great content!",1
"Hey everyone! This is Max from the course - thanks so much for checking it out. :) We've got a ton of free resources over on the blog and my website at codingwithmax.com to help those of you who are curious or want to learn more.

I hope this mini-course gives you a good basic insight into what the term 'data science' exactly entails, and I also hope it piques the curiosity in some of you to look into a career in data science! 

If you want to dive right into it, my full Data Scientist in 10 Weeks course can be found here: https://codingwithmax.teachable.com/p/data-scientist-10-weeks

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to let me know! I'll definitely hang around here and check for any questions or comments. :)",1
"Awesome video, thanks for putting in the effort to make this!  It's funny, I was totally uninterested in anything to do with math or statistics while I was in school, but now I think this stuff is really cool!  Being able to use data to learn from the past and guide your actions in the future...what's not to like?",1
Awesome breakdown on this topic Max! I  have my roots in physics as well and went into it-consulting a few years ago. I have been looking for good introductions on this topic. For me it was so much easier to follow the explanations coming from a physicist. Thanks for that!,1
"Amazing, amazing job! Nice touch with the stock photography, which looks to be original. Learned a lot from this one. Keep it up!",1
"This introduction is really clear Thank you Max for your hard work, well done!",1
"Hi Max, This is great stuff for any beginner in data science. Do you have any videos/tips on probability and logistic regression that are easy to understand as well? thanks!",1
"Hi Max, Very informative and interesting, Question, at 13:16 you talk about Continuous data and contrast every number from -infinity to +infinity (i.e. numerical infinity) with every number between ""0"" and ""1"",  however, can those numbers be equally infinite as subdivisions can be infinite?",1
"thank you so much for this!!! Im going to college in the fall to major in public health, and I was thinking of picking up a data science minor as well. This is simple enough for me to understand what the field is + what it requires!!",1
Thanks for all the great work you folks do.,1
"Damn, a data scientist is just someone who is really good at a lot of hard things.",1
"I've considered data science, but, for me, it'll come down to who wants to use the data and how. A lot of businesses want to use data science to increase profits, but I'm more interested in using data to discover things, help people, etc.",1
As someone who transferred from data science to data analysis I agree with every point here. Being in the everlasting learning process was particularly exhausting😅 Not that data analysis needs no learning but the intensity ds requires is of another level.,0
I've been considering taking a Master Degree in Data Science and Business Analytics and I was wondering what's like being a Data Scientist until I found your video!! Thanks YouTube and thanks Tina! I have more idea now!,1
This got me so excited to be a data scientist - always learning (in different fields) and getting to continue being a scientist!!. It sounds great!,1
The video we have been waiting on from Tina!! 🙌🏼,1
"1. Learn the fundamentals of Maths
2. Basic knowledge of Computers
     2.1  Learn the basics of a programming Language (e.g. R or Python)
3. The most important thing: LEARN STATISTICS ! It's by far the biggest part of data science. Machine Learning is 80% Statistics.
4. Build little projects and try to connect something with a database
5. Don't be overhelmed of all that new technology stuff. Nobobdy knows everything and you don't need everything too.",1
"I'm in cyber security doing vulnerability management, but this is making me want to get deeper into data science. I wish YouTube had more entertaining and enthusiastic creators like Tina, Ken, Luke in the cybersecurity field!!",1
"Those are valuable pieces of advice. I always get caught going deep, but my main problem is distraction.  I end up learning too many things.",0
this is was far more comprehensive than I expected! so many other channels will throw up python and SQL and will then recommend a boot-camp or moocs. Solid video and thank you very much!,1
"Very well thought - I agree with everything that has been said in the video.
I used the breadth-first approach when I changed my career to Software Engineering couple years ago, and yes, it's least painful and most effective way to learn skills for a technical industries.

Thanks for the video, I'm just starting with Data Science and this is very helpful - not that you only say what to learn, but also how and where 🤩 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",1
"This was really insightful and helpful, thanks for making this!",1
I’m currently an entry level Community Manager. Data Science is so intriguing to me as it would allow me to listen to userbases and other communities so much more closely. You just gave me what I need to get started learning! Thank you!,1
"I found this video to be very well done!! When I begin work on a new model, I always start with a Google search, and go from there. Unfortunately, you can't do this during an interview. I feel like some of the best people on planet earth get overlooked, all the time, just because employers expect people to start with a blank piece of paper, and build out a model. I've been in the data science world for the past 10 years, and that's 10 years of proven success. If that's not good enough for you, writing code on a blank sheet of paper won't help very much at all.",1
"This is very helpful, thanks for putting this together :)",1
The biggest problem I’ve had so far is working with my manager. We both have very different perspectives on various problems but he simply doesn’t even want to hear my perspective even when my perspective is usually right. We are both data scientists but he graduated as a data scientist back in 2003. So he’s an old head and I recently graduated. It’s very tough to get along and having your voice heard,0
"I'm learning Data Science and whenever I read job descriptions for entry levels or even for Interns they want you to be jack of all trades and on top of that require you to have 2,3 years of experience. Plus they include big data streamlines and ask you to be an expert on it too along with all sorts of cloud services. I mean it feels like they're demanding an Intermediate Data Scientist and terming it as ""Data Analysis Intern"" or ""Junior Data Analyst"" role. This frustrates me a lot.",0
"I feel like tech jobs always morph: we have hiring expansions and more specialities, then we have layoffs and more generalizations. It does seem like the demand for data scientists dropped off a cliff, but I’ve been studying it a bit as a way to complement other skills. Thanks for the video ☺️",1
"Its really difficult to work as a Data scientist because every company have different expections from Data Scientist. And now a days, a data scientist should know all the skills like computer vision, deep learning, Operational research, Machine learning, SQL and many more. There must a  discrete line between data scientist work roles. And also as you have mentioned interview prep, it is really difficult because we need to prep from scratch. — Struggle of a DataScientist",0
Amazing... Your way of explaining is superb ... Thank you so much,1
"I would like to have a video of How to start studying for Data science. I mean where to start and how to progress. That would be helpful for those who don't know where and how to approach Data science course. 
Congrats to the team! Thank you!",1
Very well curated!,1
I don't think I'd ever heard of this.  Thanks for explaining!,1
365 data science a best place to learn data science and today's content was super. The concept of learning things in 5mins says how this website have depth knowledge of data science. I always love 365 data science website ❤❤❤,1
Amazing. Please explain how data science will be useful in health care,1
"Very well explained, can use this video in a interview...",1
Way of exlaination is superb,1
"Great video Shane! Completely Nailed it. As a data scientist myself, I was a little surprised at how high the job satisfaction scores were.  On the job, a lot of my peers find that they aren't challenged enough by their positions. This is probably because data science is still relatively new, and companies are still figuring out how to create value with data teams. The other side of that is that once you have a data science role it is pretty easy to land another data science job so qualified data scientists can just leave if they aren't liking the position at hand. I love seeing the data and trying to map it to what I'm hearing anecdotally!",1
"I loved the remark about how if/when data scientists' jobs get automated, either the world would have ended, or world peace would have been achieved. 🤣",1
"Excellent, data-driven assessment of this field.  I am 57 with a BS in math just retired (not really, want to work in data science) and pursuing a masters in statistics.  I have one class in machine learning where neither the professor nor students are over thirty. Most of the students are early twenties and some might still be in their teens.  I was able to start on Zoom but now that we are back in the class my status is very clear although I keep fit and positive (I never lied about my age - that would be creepy but didn't need to advertise it either so long as I pulled my weight in study groups).  I feel so out of place but just shake it off and try to keep on moving forward as best I can.  You mentioned ageism and while I have not attempted to apply for any jobs yet I have experienced ageism and how one's ""value"" can diminish at a job.  The brutality of it can be very harsh on the receiving end and wonder why people do not realize they will be there sooner than they might care and wonder if they consider the world they are creating.  Me, I'll keep on going until I cannot.  I enjoy turning data into knowledge.  I am sure your analytics show your main demographic are on the younger end but wonder if you will address ageism in later videos.  Either way, keep the data and its interpretation flowing and ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light!""",1
"I’m a data analyst 
I will say, you need to be good at attention to detail and actually know your skill set
One wrong variable can skew your results majorly which can cost time and money
I’ve had to bite the bullet before and it hurts wasting hours of your life on something that needs to be redone or straight abandoned",0
"Thanks for the great content Shane. As a data scientist myself, who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially, given that my own engineering field had few jobs available, one thing I have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route. If you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline, plus the skills you need as a data scientist, you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot. While traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take, it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth. You end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do, but without the specialized domain knowledge. Coming from an engineering discipline myself, I was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways. I have noticed the same with my other peers who also don't come from the traditional route. I say this because I have met with a lot of non-traditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they can't break through. They definitely can break through and thrive in this field. They offer specialized insights you can't get through the traditional route. So if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities, like linguistics or english, you can become a powerful data scientist (with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied, such as NLP). If you are someone who comes from a STEM field, even better, because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems. All data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science. But what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem, address user needs, and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model. I don't mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off, but I do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well.",1
"Great video. I'm a data analyst and just accepted an offer for data scientist position, so I have some ideas on the markets for both jobs.

In my opinion, the window for people with no previous data experience and no degree in an analytical subject getting a job as a data scientist has almost completely closed. Those folks oftentimes won't even get past the HR screener.

There's so many new data science and analytics Master's programs that have opened up, along with the wide variety of analytical degrees that are acceptable (statistics, computer science, economics, physics, etc) that someone without an analytical degree and without any job experience as a data analyst or other data professional is just never going to get an interview. Even if you have a great portfolio, the HR screen is not even going to look at it.

However, if you have experience as a data analyst and pick up one of these new data science or analytics master's degrees the job market becomes super easy.",1
"Hi Shane, the actuary here who has commented on your channel frequently.  I would just like to point out that actuary is a special case of data scientist.  The skill sets are extremely similar, and also, there are many data scientists who are hired by insurance companies.  I haven't finished watching your video yet but I already know, this is a REALLY good one whether in or out of insurance.",1
"Shane, I would highly recommend looking into sub reddit information. I looked into data science and when you go to the data science subreddit you will see how it is nearly impossible to get a job in data science. Usually people will go into something like Business analyst to data analyst to data scientist as a means of going up the scale. Also these subreddits will help you get a better idea of the requirements of different jobs. For instance in IT career questions even though IT may be a fantastic career eventually the vast majority of entry level starts at helpdesk with a salary of $15-$20 an hour and is there for a few years before being able to make something like sys admin.",1
"Thanks Alex for all the advice, I finally landed a job as a data analyst at a tech startup. If anyones interested, I made 143 applications, had 7 interviews and got 3 offers. The process from starting the google course to landing a job took just under 3 months (I was unemployed and working on this full time). Hope that helps anyone who's looking for their next job!",1
Dear Alex... In 2 or 3 years from now I will look back at what I have achieved and I am pretty sure your channel will be one of the things I will be more grateful for... Thank you for all the important information you share here!! All my admiration from a Venezuelan young student living in Europe! :),1
Amazing video Alex! Can't believe I'm just watching this now haha. I'm a data scientist at a larger company and I wanted to also comment that there's also the data engineer role that is becoming more hot and covers the data cleaning and dashboard creation part :),1
"Great job on being concise in your comparisons between the two different job titles! I begin my master's in data science this January! I do plan to start applying to data analyst positions in the spring after I get my Oracle Database SQL Associate Certification, and may consider going for an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification as well.",1
"Hello Alex, I currently hold a masters in healthcare informatics. I am having trouble finding a job in my field. I am wondering if I should be focusing on data scientist or data analyst. I don’t have much experience when it comes to SQL, Python etc . I am wondering if I should consider enrolling in a data analytics Boot Camp. What are your thoughts?",0
"Hi Alex, you mentioned something about learning AWS/Azure for Data Analyst roles. Seeing that both of these cloud platforms have different courses/modules, where do you suggest we start from. Or is a generalist knowledge enough? Looking forward to your reply.",1
"I really like how simple your explanation about DS and DA, very helpful. I have been thinking to trying pursuing on DS career by following boot camp and course online, despite of my background as bachelor of economic. Did you have some insight for non-STEM background to undergoes this path? Thank you.",1
"Hello from Italy Alex, as a Data Scientist i can say that we are more focused on deployng new models into a business process that drives direct value, so the project management and the engeneering skills become really important (unix, professional coding, sql, git, spark, concept of testing and so on) because you have to ensure that the pipeline works in every situation even when you have really bad or poor annotated data. i don't think that you need a phd cause the algorithm that you use are pretty popular in the community (xgboost, bert, resnet and so on).",1
"Great content as usual! 

I don't know whether you already did a video about it, but do you think that data analysis is going to be saturated in the next years? 

With all these hype about data I was wondering if the offer of data analysis is going to be higher than the demand for these jobs.

Thank you for spreading the knowledge about data :)",1
"(Reminder that all resources I mentioned are linked in the description!)
Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know what your goals for this year are below! Mine Are:
- Do a project with a  Generative Adversarial Neural Net
- Enter at least 1 Kaggle Competition 
- Do at least 4 projects and share them on YouTube",1
"So I have decided that 2022 will be the best year of my life. I've started learning Python on 1st day of the year and up till now I have covered most of the basics and made some simple programs as well in last 20 days. So far it's going good. Thank you for this video. I wanted to ask, when should I start practicing on Kaggle now? I Study around 1-2 hours daily after my job and 3-4 hours on weekends...",1
"I used your project-based learning approach from last year's video to learn data science. After 15 months and 700 hours of learning (no online courses, just individual studying), I landed as job as a mid-level data scientist in financial fraud detection. Thank you! This video is spot-on. Especially your emphasis of building a roadmap and systematically updating it as you grow.

2 not-obvious study habits which I found helpful:
1. I kept multiple projects open so that after I went through a topic (e.g. feature selection), I could implement it in multiple projects.
2. For each topic in my roadmap, I kept a date of when I last implemented the technique in a project. This helped me identify important topics which I had covered a while ago and might have partially forgotten, so that I could refresh my knowledge/skills.",1
"Been waiting for this video!!!!

To anyone reading this, if you're looking to break into Data Science in 2022 I 100% recommend subscribing to Ken's channel and following his advice!!

Back when COVID-19 started in 2020, I was looking to break into the field and I had no experience, no projects, and I didn't know where to start.

6 MONTHS after subscribing to Ken's channel and soaking in all of his advice through his videos, I got a job as a Data analyst.

I'm living proof that this channel is 100% all that you need to get started. Thank you Ken and & I can't thank you enough for the doors you have opened for me.",1
"Lovely learning map, Ken ! 
And yes 4:30 math is very important ^^
Love your channel and your content, keep it up.",1
"This updated video is epic. Your pioneering ""If I had to start over"" video had inspired so many similarly named videos in the tech youtube space. Certainly agree with you on the importance of coding and how that opened up several doors of opportunities in accessing ""power tools"" for the data science learning journey. 
8:01 Also thanks for the mention 😆",1
I’ve been waiting all year for this! 🙌🏼 Solid advice Ken!,1
"Great advice on typing out other people's work. Myself as a beginner it's easy to get flustered on projects as some solutions/tools I have not yet been exposed to. By looking up other's solutions/work and typing them out it really helps me to understand the anatomy of the code. Furthermore, sometimes the solutions don't work as I am using python 3.10 and so I have to work out and start fishing around for the latest 'iteration' of the module/code and that actually helps to drive home the knowledge.",1
"Hi first of all Thank you very much for free courses I don't know I would be able to take benefit from this or not but I think you are doing a great job.  As I am Chef in a hotel in UAE and I am thinking if I could learn data science so that I can also explore new and better career I have no idea about computer science will I be able to get benefit from this 11 hour course? If not? then can you please suggest me a learning map?

Kindly Reply",1
This was just what i needed!!! Ty for explaining exactly what they do and how!!!,1
I love this! I belong here; keep it up SimpliLearn!!,1
Please add timestamps. It would be helpful.,1
Also please suggest courses which are gonna help in conducting medical research data analysis!,1
"Nice Video, could you please add timestamps? That would be great.",1
Good job,1
"Senior Econ major, I got an internship with data analysis. I hope to apply for a Data Science internship next semester. I love data science and I'm so glad that my major falls with most requirements. This channel was one of the reasons I started pursuing data science.",1
"Shane, you should interview people on your channel that work in these fields. There's a pretty big community on YouTube of data scientist. You can talk to people in all type of careers honestly, there's insight they can bring that you only get by working in the field.",1
"Well explained topic, thanks. Data rules the world, and for businesses of all sizes, it’s vital to effectively collect, store, and analyze the data to stay ahead of the competition.",1
I love seeing these videos from your channel pop up on my notifications. You should do a poll on youtube to see what career we want to see next.,1
Please do a video on the importance of top ranked universities in real world,1
Sweet! I would also be interested in Business Intelligence jobs.,1
"I agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time I think there's a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about: democratization and the experience catch 22. 

I feel like your video alluded to what I mean by democratization quite well so I think we're probably in agreement there. A lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow, pytorch, and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models. I think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boiler-plate enough that it's ripe for ""automation"" using some kind of auto-ml, the sql-like syntax that redshift and BigQuery offer, or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away. This opens ML models up to the tech-savy but non-specialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already, pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and ML-OPs. We still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often it's just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day.

For experience I really think there's a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless self-teaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people. This is where I think we disagree: the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you don't talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience. The largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you. I would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level. My expectation is that you'd see a massive gap favoring employers at 0-2 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5+ years of experience. So while the industry is expanding, the companies aren't hiring juniors, or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program.

Together I think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals. If workers with domain experience (but not a DS education) can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job I think we're going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry. Perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree",1
"Working as a PhD in a business school we often get hookups with companies about some data... and it always shocks me how little they know. I'd say they are very good at collecting data but they often have no idea how to use it (that is if there problem is anything but a straight forward prediction problem). 

My understanding are the best skills to have are 1) be able to identify problems 2) be able to decide how to solve the problem. Once that is done, usually the process is just data cleaning and then running the libraries you decided on already which is fairly trivial (though potentially data cleaning is time consuming). But honestly, don't trust me. I had to go do a PhD because nobody would hire me to do even the most basic stuff...",0
"""Prospective data scientists should focus on projects that demonstrate the ability to understand business context""
This! This is very important!",1
The whole data science industry is booming from analyst to engineers to scientist and you will see domain experts leading this field more and more,1
"What a beautiful and insightful explanation of the dynamics of data science. It is true that data science demand is growing exponentially and what aspiring data scientists are fearful is lack of knowledgeable that DS is actually evolving and diverse. It is become more field specific and one need to master the area of expertise like health, business, banking etc in respect to the application of DS in it. Thanks a lot Thu Vu for your resourceful info.",1
"This video was soooo informative and encouraging. I’m a neuroscience major looking to enter data science after college and have been trying to focus my skills in learning R, data visualization, and statistical analysis. Class of ‘23!",1
"not you being a literal life saver! im graduating early and i had no clue what i could do with my applied mathematics degree without going to grad school, and the way you describe this (the constant learning, the work environment) honestly makes this sound like the job for me :) thank you!",1
I so needed this video today! I just finished my Masters in Data Analytics and as someone who has always despised job hunting I was getting disenfranchised. But you have put the fire back in my belly! All of the great things you said about the career are all the reasons I started the Masters. So thank you for reminding me!,1
"hey, awesome vid! I was a data analyst before I had a maternity leave and I wanted so much to become a data scientist because I think it's a logical progression of my work challenge path. Unfortunately, currently I have different plans for my life but I wanted to say that you made me come back to my prev plans and inspired me again on the topic.",1
"Great video! I'm quite interested in pursuing a career in data science in the future, and I'm wondering if you've got any tips/tricks for someone who's somewhat got his basics down. Looking forward to more of your videos!",1
"I have a very similar background to you. I am a former physics undergraduate that did research in high energy physics simulations, and that computational background really helped me transition into my current data science position. For any physics/math undergrads, you have the skill set to get into this field! The only obstacle is being able to express your math knowledge through code. If you can learn enough code to do that, you're golden.",1
Thank you for this video!  Currently applying for a Master's in Data Science and this is great anecdotal support.,1
"Very informative video! I agree with many of your points, and I'd like to add some of my own (I'm a Lead Data Scientist at an American unicorn):

1. We don't really care about your background as long as you can code (SQL and Python), understand the fundamentals of statistics and can apply standard ML models. Your education might limit your progress later on, but the basics are plenty enough for you to do well as an entry-level data scientist.
2. Communication is _really_ important. We expect all new hires to be good on the technical side, so what ends up being the most significant discriminator between high- and low-level is how well you can understand what's being requested and what's important and communicate your results in a way that helps the business. This is the number 1 thing I mention to my reports during 1:1s.
3. Many Data Science courses (BAs or Masters) don't teach SQL, or if they do, it's just basic stuff. Regardless of what your actual role as a data scientist will be, SQL will always be essential.",1
Super informative thank you for all the info! I just switched majors from CS to I.T. And thinking of Pursuing a masters degree in data science. Do you think that the masters degree would make of a difference early on and for entry level roles? (Salary wise) Overall im just kind of trying to figure out where to go from here haha,1
"Thank you so much for the insight on data science as a ""new path"". I have degree on agriculture and now I'm just starting on takin course, professional certification and etc in data science (I'm more interested into this stuff than my main degree tbh lol). Mainly just to get into DS job, and also getting new skill to go along with my main degree seems pretty nice addition,",1
"Thank you for this course, sir. It was a great 12 hour journey. Coming from non CS background, I had little to no knowledge about all this stuff but this video has given me enormous amount of confidence that I can program and explore data science further. Thanks again!",1
Thanks for the course! I’m playing this at 1.25x speed and it’s perfectly understandable and saves a couple of hours of reproduction,1
Thank you for doing such a good service to the community by bringing such amazing quality content for free. I cant tell you how much I appreciate it. Lots of love and respect to the team.,1

"That’s a great concise video summing up the role of a professional data scientist, this video came at the right moment as I transition from academia to industry and totally relate with many of the points mentioned in the video. As mentioned in the later part of the video, I also find the undesirable aspect of data science to be a double-edged sword as on one end the ambiguity may make things unclear but at the same time also leaves room for experimentation and innovation. Papaya Tracker sounds like an interesting personal project!",1
"Im 35 years old, and I just started my Data Science journey by starting college this semester.  Been an aircraft mechanic for my entire adult life and been looking for a change for years now and you inspired me to finally pursue Data science. Thank You Ken, I'll be tuning into your channel just to keep my 'ear to the ground' in this exciting field. Also, not sure if you spoke on this before, but what laptop do you recommend for data science? Thanks Buddy and keep up the good work!",1
"This actually answered a couple of questions I had about working professionally. I know that SW Engineers typically work in an agile framework but wasn't sure if Data Science followed that same trend. Thanks Ken!

Now to watch this 400,000 more times so we can beat Forrest.",1
"One of the most important things that I wish more people would do is documentation. Of datasets, sources, code, rationale etc. I often have to spend a long time on the dataset exploration phase of the project and trying to figure out things. Everything would be much smoother if people created detailed documents on the different Datasets, how things are collected, what features are used, distributions etc",1

Also trying to get a good grasp on machine learning and deep learning principles as I go, and making sure I’m sharp with my statistics and linear algebra skills.",1
I'm working as an Associate Data Scientists at a startup and I honestly haven't needed to code for like 5 months. They've got me focused on an e-learning initiative.,1

This video confirmed my understanding and also cleared up confusion as many people, my employer, and consumers of our products have different views of a data science work role.",1
"As a data scientist myself, I agree that anyone can become a data scientist. It definitely takes a significant amount of time and effort though. I have multiple videos about how to get into the field on my channel for those who are interested!",1
"As a data scientist, I would agree with the fact that we are lazy people that want maximum results with minimum effort - and think we can solve any problem given enough data. :D",1
"'anyone can be a data scientist' - that's the gist of this lecture.....What it requires is a combo of math stats n computer science skills topped u with communication and management soft skills.....Data is the new thing from which physicists, engineers, social scientists can draw n infer conclusions based on past history or some kind of logic.......And this is the best time ever for fast processing of loads of data........Right time to be data scientist! You can work in any domain! Good introductory talk👍",1
This was very precise and at the same time a very broad view at this field. Thank you sir.,1
Thanks Mr.Asitang Mishra. You have motivated me more to pursue data science ❤️,1
"Inspiring, transparent talk! ✅",1
Soooo good! I love it and Mr. Mishra's smart humor! Very good overview with some fun laughs in it too!,1
Felt proud watching ✌️Being a data scientist I can relate what speaker said... Problem solving is the essence..,1
"thanks a lot, Mr.Asitang Mishra!
you've convinced me to study DS more",1
this talk was really the best of its kind 👍,1
"I don't agree with any of this. The only way to get a data science job is to first get a job as a janitor at an esteemed university. Start looking for math problems on chalk boards. Solve them. Become a professor. Solve math. Wait... this is the plot from good will hunting. Nevermind. 

In hindsight, this is really great advice. How about them apples.",1
"Great video Tina! Loving the minimize input maximize output (MIMO) series. My step into the world of data was from a non-technical (biology) background and persistence and grit was probably one of the most important thing because it took quite some time to digest the coding or algorithmic concepts. I also resonated with your prior MIMO video on learning data science particularly on learning just enough and start doing projects. I also leveraged data science to solve biology data problem (that helps to make a positive impact in this video) which at the time was a novel thing. I repeated this cycle for solving various biology data problems and before you know it, topics that I used to get stuck on became less intimidating and started to sink in. Your persistence through 200 SWE roles is very inspirational 😆",1
"Hey Tina, thank you so much for always sharing wonderful tips. It is almost approaching a year since I had finished my bachelors and still without a job :(! I really hope I can break the barrier and get my foot in the industry. Having zero experience makes everything harder. Apart from doing some projects, I will definitely try to contribute in open source projects or pick up a consulting assignment.",1
I'm a Ocean Sciences BSc and now I'm starting another degree in Information Systems. Your channel is motivating me to follow the Data Science path. Keep up the awesome work!,1
Amazing how much effort so many people put into to getting a job while someone with connection can bypass it all and get the job.,1
"Hi Tina, this was really great advice about demonstrating your impact, super useful for data science people but I feel like it's relevant to every field too. Please could you do a video on how you deal with rejection? I'm job hunting in a field that's very new to me (not data science) at the moment and I'm just so afraid of getting rejected because that could mean the end of my dream. Also, even if it doesn't, the feeling just sucks lol.",0
"Hi Tina! Do you think doing only analysis is good for your resume? For example, imagine that I scrape data from glassdoor and I do a analysis on the salaries of data scientists in the US. After finishing the analysis on the data, I got some pretty cool insights but I didn't use Machine Learning in the end project. 
So, is a project like that good for my resume?
I'm a major in Data Science and your videos help a lot.",1
"Honestly, the frustrating thing for me at work as data analyst/scientist is I never saw our clients give any feedback about how our reports were helpful for them and change their projects. AKA. ""business impact like what you described."" I always comfort myself that ""even just a little impact. and that's enough.""",0
"Hi Tina, you make me want to make my first comment on Youtube - your videos are SUPER helpful and please keep making more interesting and insightful videos! I am actually thinking of transitioning to data science from a business background and you gave me a lot of useful tips that solves my confusion :)",1
"Hmmm I'm going the applied math route with stats as a minor or possibly masters. Is there any reason in particular that you would recommend CompSci beyond just the programming background it provides? Also, how different is data science compared to machine learning? They sound almost like the same thing (given their job descriptions). Great video btw!",1
Glad we needed a scientist to tell us that you get rich by starting a business with a competitive advantage. :),1
I feel for a local business owner who opened up a coffee shop. My two sister's worked there and were very good friends with the owner since she was a teacher at the highschool and saved up enough money to open the shop up. Sadly during the pandemic my state nuked her businesses. My sister's lost their jobs while the governor praised herself about her actions and those evil businesses were destroying our state. She then proceeded to get caught twice having parties spending thousands on booze.  Actually watched dozens of business get nuked the same way fun times fun times.,0
"so as a technician I worked at a dealership (two actually) owned by the same guy. He has like 10 different dealerships and he is insanely wealthy. Like, he owns all of this property north of a major highway and is literally like a king in these lands. To be honest he also seems like a pretty nice guy.",1
"Since I was little I knew I’d rather live in the street than become a wage slave and have to relive the school experience of being told what to do. Having to negotiate with incompetent managers for a 5% increase every year just sounds insane to me. I studied software engineering so I could build my own tools and sell them. Took countless 70+ hour work weeks but the work does pay off now own half of a successful tech startup. Currently using that income to start two other companies with virtually no competition in my area in other industries I’m interested in.

Entrepreneurship is the way. Made my first M at 26. Currently 27.",0
Being a trade professional such as plumbing or HVAC can be VERY lucrative if you spend the time and money to consistently build name recognition in your local market and maintain that for years. If you can become the name that people automatically think of for HVAC problems - you can multiple hire crews to do the work for you. You can scale as big as you want and easily become a millionaire - with a tech school diploma - you just have to grow that name recognition and provide quality service.,1
"Remember he’s a Data Scientist. He’s probably studied data on the topic immensely before this interview as that’s what we love doing especially with public data that’s nice to play with. So the advice he’s giving probably tends to bounce towards what’s most PROBABLE, not what will DEFINITELY make you rich. In most ways probability can you take you a long way.",1
"Wow, what a great course with an awesome professor.  He goes way beyond teaching the mechanics of statistics but makes distinctions and asks thought provoking questions that really help you crystallize in your head what you are trying to do.",1
"Absolutely the best video on statistics that I have found on YouTube - and I've viewed several such videos. I like that the professor explains a topic from many angles, has charisma, patience with class questions and includes many real-world examples. It's the perfect blend of theory and applied statistics.",1
"As practicing design engineer in West Cost medical industry, I find Professor Dr. Sarkar way of explaining the most complex subject in a practical approach very rewarding and helps in right metal representation for long term understanding. Although I have taken similar courses in Stanford paying close to 2K plus USD came out even more confused and even gave up statistical approach . Thanks for sharing for free and hope this benefits the transition from Excel based modeling to Python and would highly recommend to any one working with data and design.",1
Thanks a lot for putting up such great content. The instructor took a very practical approach to DS rather than just theories.,1
"Wonderful content and presentation, I feel like I missed Dr.Sarkar sir all these days. Thanks to greatlearning team for these lectures. It will be great if a video is made up on time series Analysis also. Thanks team for all your effort and introduce to us the great professor Dr.Sarkar sir.",1
"He is really a great professor. I have been studying statistics since school and then using years for my profession. However, the way he teach and explain from one chapter to another chapter and subject is super. Thanks",1
I am greatly impressed with this lecture. So simplified with imaginable analogies. Thank you so much sir and the greatlearning team.,1
"Fantastic course!  For those who have a fear factor of stats and probability, this course will certainly will help allay those fears.  Dr. Sarkar focused on concepts with perfect analogies which helps understand the subject better.  Thank you Dr. Sarkar.",1
"This was really the best course I Did, Learned alot and earned the certificate of completion as well.Thank you so much Great Learning for this Beautiful content and Dr.Abhinanda Sarkar Sir is the best is explaining things.Thank you very much @GreatLearning",1
"It becomes over whelming to see the job requirements for a Data Science role in India. It's hard not to fall in the trap of not knowing a lot of stuff even having a strong foundation in Python, Probability and statistics. Also I've taken a few courses from you guys till 15th of April and they were awesome. 

But would you also recommend us some of the projects we can have in our portfolio which will help us stand out?",1
Great videos and great data science courses. I used the free preview option and I am happy to learn data science and machine learning. Thanks so much for this opportunity!,1
"This was a very nice and informative video.  Hopefully I can get a data scientist/analyst position with only a bachelor's degree, but I should consider graduate programs in my area.  Thanks!",1
Your courses are amazing thank you for bringing us this opportunity 365 data science team,1
"Hello, I have a question related to your area of studies chart, If I study a degree In Computer Science and then I study a Data Science Master, In your area of studies chart, I would be on Computer Science, on Data Science and analysis or in both (this doesn't much sense I think)?


Thanks a lot, I enjoy your videos!!",1
The introductory course that you offer in Tableau is awesome!,1
The way you conduct lessons are awesome,1
I am always waiting to see your new videos. The premiere option is great choice to do!,1
"Oh.My.God. 

That was such a great video and EXACTLY what I was looking for. I am about to start a Data Science Master's next year and was looking for an overview on how to best prepare for it and you gave me that and so much more, even combined with such a great presentation.

How is your channel that small? 
Please continue what you are doing, you are awesome! :)",1
Thank you for this. I've been searching for this breakdown for a long time. Clear concise and to the point.,1
Such an amazing vibe! Thanks for the really cool videos! Been looking into data science post studies in Industrial Engineering. Your channel has beereally informative. Thanks you!:),1
"Hello, I've been watching this youtube channel a lot and found it really helpful. If you don't mind me asking a simple question? Is it quite common to solve normal algorithm coding test (the one that for SWE for usual) for a DS interview? Thank you.",1
A question I've been asking myself for years! Never went to college. But crushed AP stat and Calc in high school 10+ years ago LOL. Have been interested to see what to expect in brushing the dust off this knowledge!,1
Killer video. I think one area that is always overlooked in a predictive field like data science is causality. It's a really important area in order to understand how confounding can impact model power. Really digging your videos by the way..!,1
Such an amazing vibe! Thanks for the really cool videos! Been looking into data science post studies in Industrial Engineering. Your channel has been really informative. Thanks! :),1
Great video!  There's just so much to unpack when it comes to data science!,1
I am officially on a quest to watch all your videos! You are GREAT!! Btw what would you recommend for someone pivoting into the field with no experience?,1
"Finished the video! It feels like a game changer in terms of perspective to me. Plus, It's so informative and You can be so funny! Thank you!",1
Very helpful content for beginners...Neatly explained...Refreshed topics which I learnt with good examples...,1
Thank you so much you people are always on top of expectations 👏👏👏,1
you guys are just awesome ..your learning technique is too good....keep it up and thank you so much to all edureka! team....$$##,1
U guys r just awesome. Keep it up. The vedios aroused my interest in data science,1
*ONE OF THE BEST YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR **#DATA** **#SCIENCE** WHICH EXPLAINED EVERY CONCEPTS DEEPLY..*,1
"Thank you so much for this content! It changed my life and turned me into completely different person. I tell about what I do in terms of artificial intelligence, cyberspace, software development, drones and lifestyle on my channel. I would highly appreciate your feedback!",1
"My dude, humbled by the shoutout! 🙏🏼 

I disagree though... 10:29 your videos are the ones that are on a whole other level! 🙌🏼",1
"“Don’t quit” is definitely one of the biggest pieces of advice for people wanting to break into the field. Took me a year and a half of that horrible trial and error learning, quitting, starting again, and networking to finally land my DA role, and I don’t regret a second of that journey.",1
"Amazing content Stefan. I’m currently a student at a university in Florida, majoring in business analytics and information systems (which yeah basically trained you to become a data analyst). I’m a senior now but i feel like i learned shit in the last 3 years (despite getting all A and paying tons of money). I learned from your videos way more than in the college classroom.",1
"Considering I am extremely broke, this was MASSIVELY helpful bc you recommended FREE ways to learn various things, and I desperately need that. I also need to know what skills will be most useful to hiring managers and recruiters AND how to effectively prove it in my CV, so that was also very appreciated. The very structured approach to this video was extremely helpful, thank you very much!",1
"I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this video. Nowhere else I've seen someone ""telling it like it is"" in such a  concise way. THANK YOU! 
Subscribed to Luke's Channel following your recommendation as I also see data analysis as a stepping stone.",1
I needed to hear this. I am starting the journey of becoming  a Data analyst at 52. Thank you so much.,1
"Excellent video, I've seen tons of this ""starting"" videos and you actually gave practical and specific tips to start. Thank you!",1
"Thanks a ton brother! That was really resourceful and the exact advice I was looking for 👏🏻
Also, if you could suggest any useful certifications to consider that would add up well in the profile, that would be great.
Thanks again 🙏🏻",1
"It's so important that people like you come up with such good content in order to teach folks that data science is not just about programming language and applying random ML libraries to get >90% efficiency. Like you said, Math and stat is always the key and everyone should start with that, even though we don't often use it in real world scenario in companies.",1
"This video was helpful! I'm currently a UX Researcher and have my feet in both qualitative and quantitative research, where the quantitative requires a lot of data analysis. I enjoy diving into data, but wasn't sure which route I should take for my particular job to build out more of a niche in a Quant UX Researcher role. Now I feel like I know more of what I want to dive into further and want to focus more on the Data Analysis route.",1
"+1 on the book! It is a great resource to start with! And it also has coding exercises, which helps a lot with practicing stats and coding.",1
"Hi Ma'am, 
Sincerely thank you for sharing such a valuable information especially for me as I have been just wandering on YT and other mediums to just get started. I want to remember this day and this video down the lane when I figure out where I belong in the Venn diagram and achieve it. Thank you for pointing out a much efficient approach and direction.
Truly,
Sharat",1
"Thank you so much. I was literally feeling lost to figure out what should  I learn first. Python, R, SQL. Now, I got hope. Thank you so much for your videos.",1
"I absolutely agree with your comments about statistics and I love/own/have read the same book cover to cover. There is now a 2nd edition with python implementation. BTW, reason I am leaving comment is to hear your thought about the actual interview questions. I recently went through google data scientist interview (1 hour tech screen) and to my surprise, the question was straight out ""coin flip"" probability and expectation problem... I was really surprised because the question is very much contrived and I couldn't come up with the answer very easily at first. That was the only question (some resume related question before that, of course) I got in the session. As a data scientist myself, those type of questions are really hit or miss and personally I don't think it'd help to measure one's understanding of stats or technical background. How would you suggest prepare those?",1
"Thank you for such an informative video, appreciate people from real time experienceare sharing it with people which will he a great help to so many.., I'm working as a software engineer but don't think I'm good at technical so was thinking to move to non technical roles. And these thoughts are really tiring when u end up in too many options and not able to conclude. I am with Bsc maths and Msc computers background,  and in 2016 thought searched so much how to utilise my maths skills in IT, but unfortunately couldn't find so much that time..now when I hear on Data scene I feel I lost so much opportunity,  but I would like to resstart my learning and your videos are really inspiring. Is it okay for a person with almost 8years gap from Bsc maths to start on Data science now? Please reply",1
"thanks for sharing your experience in transitioning to data scientist role.  Some of your suggestion is good which is actually what I'm doing so far, watching different you tube video on on same topic because as you pointed out  different people has their own way of  interpretation of the subject and is more simplified , until you fully grasp the subject.  Please keep sharing your knowledge.",1
Valuable content and glad to see someone pointing out a book they read because it's not easy to pick a good book as there's many of them. Thank you for sharing,1
"Hey Sundas,
Great Video! Thanks for sharing your tips.
I have one suggestion/request on a topic you should do i video on. 
Paths of carrer progression in data science/analytics. This will be helpful for people like me who have already spent a year or two in data science field to understand what are the directions you can take to progress in this field.",1
"What a journey! Hard work always pays off, thanks for sharing and motivating us all!",1
"Awesome video! I completed 2 years of medical school but had to withdraw due to my poor physical health (chronic pain). Computer science was my backup if I was unable to get into medical school. I'm currently learning python through Udemy's online course. The tech world is so broad and I feel overwhelmed. I'm hopeful that things will workout for me in the end, but med school debt is no joke.",1
Great video!  Thanks for sharing all of your experiences!  How difficult was it to be proficient in Spark?  It’s such a different mindset!,1
"Thank you for a lovely video. 

I must admit, that what you said really helped me reevaluate some things about how I have been handling my own situation. 

Thank you! 

In fact I like the video so much, that I clicked the 'like button' seventeen times!",1
Love your videos! I would love for you to talk more about your experience with working at a startup.,1
Thank you very much for sharing your educational background with us! Exciting as ever.,1
"Perfect time for me to find your channel, as I will begin pursuing an MS Data Science degree at Vanderbilt in the Fall. Looking forward to more great content from you!",1
The wait is over! Glad to see you back on the YouTubes! 🙌🏼,1
"Very informative. I’ve got an engineering degree and had courses like probability & statistics, linear algebra, integral and differential calculus. I have a letter of acceptance from a community college in Canada for Business and Advanced Analytics in a post grad diploma program with subjects like python, sql, machine learning, etc. I’m studying python and data science online at the moment in preparation for my Winter 2023 intake. Will brush up my knowledge on statistics, linear algebra and calculus by August as this is a requirement by the program. Back in the days, I had the opportunity to represent our school in Math competitions. What surprises me is that I can still study for 5 - 8 straight hours everyday and sometimes forgetting my businesses as I now leave my managers to decide on their own. What do you think are the chances of people in their mid 40’s getting a job without experience as a data analyst or data scientist?",1
"This helped me realise that I am more interested in building things rather than discovering them. What a great and informative video, thank you Tina!",1
"I have a masters of data science but once I started working in a data position, I have realized that I enjoy more of the coding and building. Whether its writing Python, SQL, or R code for building and analyzing data, or building reports in SSRS, those are the aspects of my job that I most enjoy. I have been considering changing careers to software engineering. Also, I do feel like data scientists are expected to know too much these days. From communication, data visualization, statistics and deep learning, to cloud platforms, Spark and now Docker. That is a ton of skill and knowledge that seems super-human!",1
"Great explanation: ""building products vs discovering insights""",1
"As someone who is working in the Data Analytics side, I wholeheartedly agree with this. Data science is a new field which basically supports or optimizes how to do business. Software engineering leans more on building software or applications where normal people can use/consume. If you want to create your own business in the tech industry, software engineering should be necessary. If you want to support existing businesses, data science is the way.

I'm planning to create my own business on the food industry and I can see that data science can help it a lot.",1
"Thanks for the informative video!  Just a caveat on the salary comparison: data science often requires graduate-level education (Master's or PhD)/considers it an asset whereas software engineers do not. Or, if without a graduate degree, it's not uncommon to work as a Data Analyst for 1-2 years before becoming a Data Scientist. So while the average salary may be higher for Data Scientists, there's likely some additional education/work experience factored in.",1
"This is the most systematic and detailed review of any of the two careers I’ve ever seen. Thanks for this video, it definitely helped in finding my next step!",1
"This helped me soo much! I was really on the fence but I'm leaning towards Software Development just because I have serious doubts that I could present the Data in a parsable/usable way. 

I like coding, so I'll stick with that, but I also LOVE working with numbers, so I'm hoping I can land a Data Analyst job somewhere down the line. Thanks for providing the insight.",1
"THIS is the video everyone should watch when starting to learn data science! 🤓

So many great lessons in this, Thu!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼",1
"A great tour de force video, Thu!  Many thanks for putting this together.  So much great information - will be taking notes on my 2nd and 3rd viewings😀. Keep up the good work!",1
"This is just excellent, bravo for packaging so much information and insights in such short time and positive energy! Thank you, Thu.",1
Excellent video! I love how you presented the content...it's packed full of information and you get straight to the point with interesting graphics. There's lot's of value add in this 14 min video. Great work putting this together! subbed :),1
"Great tips, thanks for sharing! Really resonated with knowing what to learn and keeping the momentum, even if it's 2 minutes",1
Watching your videos gives me inspiration to keep going and avoid total burnout. I let go software engineering bootcamp for data science. Hence your videos also contribute to my productive day and my mental health.,1
"Hi Thu, you are AMAZINGGGG!! i was just looking for a video like this and you uploaded it. cannot thank you enough!! your videos so informative! so focused directionally and full of personal experiences!!! and could not find any other person sharing such information!! 
 thank you for sharing all of this!!!",1
"Dear Thu, thank you for sharing your guidence. As being an aspiring data scientist, it would be a lot of confusion on path what to learn and what not to.  Your video covers it well. I find it is a good guidence to me.  Thanks",1
Thank you so muchh for your great sharing!! Its really useful for me since i just started learning data analysis for my career change. Really love the content <3,1
"i think to move faster u have to make your basics strong (python DS, ML concepts, SQL concepts etc) some error can be solved if the basics is clear.",1
I'm so happy that you started giving courses on machine learning. I appreciate your clear teaching style.,1
"Words are not enough to appreciate what you present in your channel, I do believe you are number one in programming.",1
"for info: 
1) At 32:52, to avoid UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, we need to train the model with the values of input_dataset. i.e, use X.values instead of X in model.fit(X.values, y). 
2) 42:04, joblib is now a seperate py package. we now need to import it as import joblib rather than from skilearn.externals. 
Anyway thanks Mosh for another great tutorial..",1
"Finally, I found something practical rather than theoretical.
Thank you sir😇",1
"Mister Mosh, thank you for all of the easy to follow tutorials that you make for us, please keep keep up the good work, i hope you post more courses (preferably in python)  :)",1
"I'm so glad I stumbled upon this. You are amazing! This was very pleasant and easy to follow. I learned a ton and I especially like that you took us through your thought process while examining the music data set, too. Thank you very much! Subscribed.",1
You are the reason why I started programming. I'll never forget the things you've done to help me.,1
Thank you so much! Very clear and neat explanation! I hope you will continue diving deeper into detailed concepts rather than concentrating only on basics. Your way of explanation plus the details would be the great video for all I think!,1
Amazing tutorial! You explained everything so clearly and helped me to grasp some of the topics even better!,1
"Hey Mosh, your contents and teaching style  are straightforward and easy to follow. It would be great help if you do some tutorials based on medical imaging (CT,MRI) data! I am having difficulties in dealing with those. Thank you!",1
Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know if you think data science is on the rise or decline below!,1
"The Data Science King 🤴 has spoken; Data Science is NOT DYING!!

Very much agree with this, Ken!  I also will add that I feel there is going to be a stronger need for data engineering as we go into the future.",1
"As someone who's a relatively new data scientist, thanks for giving me all the confirmation bias that I needed Ken 😉",1
"Great insights Ken. I certainly agree that data science's decline is far from sight. In the life science domain, the use of data science has started to scratch the surface and there's a whole new frontier of possibilities.",1
"The sentiment is maybe coming from the difficulties to find your fist job if you are an aspiring data scientist. Rejection and unclear expectations (most companies have no idea how to find and sort data-scientists) may make many believe that is was just a fad, and they came a little late to the party.",0
"Great insights as always Ken! The data science umbrella is so large, that several ""titles"" will be more defined by companies to find the person with the skill set required to solve their problems.",1
Data science is definitely not dying and for the fact it's only scaling much bigger. Companies have started seeing the advantage of using data and data science and organisations are adopting data which is in fact create more demand for data experts 💯.,1
"Currently building up skills to eventually try and become a data analyst! Enjoyed the dope content, should def do some more!",1
"Justin, not only great editng but loved how you shared the life of a data analyst!!  Looking forward to more content from you 🙌🏼",1
This is so easy to understand and inspiring to see data analyst's daily life. Thank you for making such a useful video.,1
"OMG, this is awesome, this the only real day in a life I've ever seen, usually it's just some blog eating fancy food and going to the gym, never telling exactly what they do, but this guy did it correctly, congrats!",1
This was so much fun to watch and immensely encouraging for me to continue my studies,1
"Awesome video! Are there any other tech skills being applied to your typical workday outside of SQL? Perhaps Excel, Python, etc?",1
"I love this and even the food vlog portion. I""m a recruiter so it's interesting to see what it's like in the roles I commonly get to work on. Thanks for the great experience and video.",1
"What an awesome video, thank you for sharing it. For someone that wants to become a DA as a career, what kind of courses or learnings would you suggest they take in the beginning, for example, Excel, Power BI, SQL, VBA, etc?",1
"As a person who needs to deal frequently with data at my office, my biggest nightmare is not getting required data from the stakeholders.",0
I am from Newyork and I am happy that you shared this video with us and the life I have dreamt about. I am in my final year of college and I have been applying to a lot of job opportunities. What kind of projects do you recommend to entry level Data Analyst. I have been making dashboard in tableau and doing my analysis in Excel and Sql. Where do you get the datas to do self projects,1

This makes me so excited to be a data scientist! Thank you for the video.,1
"Hi Priya- thank you for this video. I am concluding my last year as a student receiving my BS in data analytics. And I have so many questions that are causing me anxiety. As I am nearing the end of my journey I have realized that the path in computer science ( DS/DA) is not structured like one probably imagined it would be. What I am wondering is if you encountered the same during your journey in terms of learning these program tools (Python, SQL, tableau, R,) if what’s important while in school is getting a basic understanding of these tools and how to use them,  but the real challenge starts after graduating, in teaching yourself on how to use these tools more effectively to actually be able to draw meaningful insights ?

Did you have to hone your skills a bit more once you graduated before you started to apply to jobs? I have beginner level on all these programs right now but I feel like I probably won’t be able to land a job in data analytics until I’m at least intermediate in SQL and at least Python, for starters. I would appreciate your feedback, and would also love to connect with you offline to chat if possible. Congratulations again on your journey and your role in data science.",0
Thank you for this video. This is extremely helpful as I am currently applying to data science and quantitative analytics positions.,1
"Want to quickly commend you for the consistency and quality of your content. I don't usually comment - but from helping me with my UChicago application (where I will be attending next year :D) to now supporting me in identifying my future career (I am very interested in data science), I am grateful to you for all your work. Thanks!",1
"10:00 this is an extremely hard coding task. It deals with a custom data-type, implies the iteration and verification of the end. I wasted 40 minutes and didn't resolve it, all the solutions I have found, include flattering with a separate method, than iterating and len() verification. And the task is formalized in a way, that next() and hasNext() methods should be enough to do the flattening (which is again more difficult).
I am not sure if it is a suitable task for a middle software developer in a fortune-500 company coding interview. Comparing this with the ""explanation of the gradient descend"" is like chalk and cheese.",0
Great video!  I appreciate the honesty.  Did you start as an analyst before moving to a Data Scientist role?  What role would you recommend for recent grads?,1
"A scientist who works in data science has been a godsend. Finding a job has been difficult in the wake of my graduation and several unsuccessful job applications. After weighing my options, I chose to leave physics and hunt for a position in data science. Before seeing your videos, I was baffled as to why I continued being turned down for jobs despite having two master's degrees, one in physics and the other in applied physics. Now that I've seen some of your vids, I understand why. Glad I found your channel on YouTube:)",1
"just start my datacamp journey, thank you for this helpful insight, I have one question, how do you know that some company just using you for their free project while they actually don't want to hire anyone.",1
"Very understandable approach to explaining the differences in these roles. It's definitely appreciated, especially with the blurred lines that companies often use to represent these fields.",1
"Really nice video. I am a current data analyst at a large tech company, hoping to become a ML engineer eventually (similar to a google software engineer whose capable of everything in that chart). Love the content, keep it up.",1
great video! thanks for clearing that up and explaining the various elements of so many different roles in this field! very helpful.,1
"I am a marketing project manager and i was wondering if i could shift my path to data scientist/analyst, and your amazing video made it clear for me, thanks very much",1
"subs.. I've been seeing your video on my feed for a while now since I started roaming around to study software development but my true goal was to go up to the data scientist role, that's just the goal I have in mind and you just revealed to me that I don't exactly NEED to become a software engineer first if I can land myself to a data analyst role, the hierarchy showed me I can still walk up slowly to reaching my goal.. you are a god send.. :)",1
thanks man for clearing this up... especially in India ...all IT companies have made a mess about Data jobs...why don't you make a video dscussing these JDs ...especially from India....? these all are MNC's,0
"That's a very nice explanation, I'd love to see each step in-depth",1
This video helped me pass my data scientist interview! Thanks!,1
"I love your videos! I had one quibble about your SQL solution to #1. If some publishers have more videos than others, then their video durations will affect the mean. You could imagine one publisher with 10,000 videos and 9 publishers with 10 videos. In this case, the average duration of that one super-publisher's videos will have way more influence on the mean than the other publishers. I think your question is better answered by first computing an average for each publisher and then averaging those averages. (of course, this detail may not matter in an interview)",1
LOL very impressive that you can make a video about interview questions so fun to watch 😂 🙌,1
"I really love your channel, it has helped me understand what DS really is. I am an incoming freshmen and will be pursuing DS!! This seems hard right now but as the years go this will all make sense. Keep up the good work.",1
"I think this is a good video for suggestions on how to get a data science job at a larger company. However in my experience data science interviews at non-large companies put a huge focus on machine learning/deep learning, linear algebra, statistics, core python programming (sometimes R), SQL, spark/AWS/GCP, and data visualization (tableau, matplotlib, R)",1
"Hi Jonathan, awesome video. Please rate the online data science or big data courses and share your opinion regarding if they are any good in landing you a job vs a Masters in CS.",1
Dude love the cut outs! Great video!,1
"Maaaaaan, the way you explain stuff makes me feel like this is something reachable, despite of its level of complexity. You make it sound, somehow, easy. Not because it is, but because you suggest a self development path for those who want to learn on their own. There are many out there who put themselves on a superior position, maybe caused by their formal-education ego, but for some reason you must follow their same steps, which means you'll never be as awesome as they are. 

Thanks for breaking it down for humans. Big hug from Argentina, and keeping on rocking with that good work 💪🏻",1
"Update comment: I’m one month into my new career as a data analyst at a large charter school company (over 20 analysts on our team). I just wanted to come back here and say thank you! I focused on positions within education (changing from a 14 year career as a math teacher) and landed a position within a month of starting my job search.

SQL and Excel are used a lot! My advice to anyone starting out is to get comfortable with those two programs (especially Inner Joins with SQL and PivotTables with Excel).",1
"Fantastic video, as a BA I can attest that SQL and Excel are still very much in demand.  After being at one job for 15 years I had to put myself back on the market.  After doing the excel, SQL and powerBI assessments on LinkedIN to back my resume ahead of the screenings the jobs and some cool offers started rolling right in.",1
This is great! I am trying to transition from sales/management to data analyst and eventually data science. Great video to help individuals like myself transitioning careers into something they truly enjoy; problem solving.,1
"Thanks for the insights Luke. Just one quick question, how was your experience of using Windows on a Macbook Pro? Does it help with using Excel, SQL etc.? Keep up the good work!",1
"Always entertained by what I learn from your channel, Luke! Thanks for reinforcing a well-rounded path to learning! I'm gonna use Ken Jee's 66 Days of Data to shape my tech skills. ☺",1
"Thank you for this video, it was very helpful. I’ve been wondering where to start and what to focus on. This was clear and well spoken. I have a few courses on Udemy I’m starting on excel, data analytics, python, sql and a couple on wishlist including power bi and tableau that all include projects. I guess I chose selection well, thanks for confirmation. Also I’m going to do coursera when I’m done.",1

Would be great if you provide a course playlist for the same from basic to advanced. 🤞🏻,1
We got a very clear vision towards Data Science. Thank you. We love to watch more videos related to this.,1
Who's ready for learning data science in 2021!? ✋✋✋,1
"Just learning enough, moving on and iterating. That’s a great tip. When learning almost anything I tend to go deeper in one of the initial steps and feel stuck.",1
"Love the strategy and the “not getting too deep into one subject” advice. Definitely better to know a bit of everything than only one thing very well, especially for interviews!",1
"This is pretty much how I went through it as well in the last few years.  I actually started web scraping before machine learning, as ML really benefits from good scrapers and database building.",1
I've been so stressed about how to best learn data science without wasting time and this is SO helpful!!,1
"Hi Tina, thank you for providing these useful info for learning data science knowledge. I'm going to pursue a MSDS soon, and I'v learned python ML,  MySql, and some Hadoop during my free time, beside working on some resume projects and keep practicing the skills, are there anything I can do to ensure myself getting an intern? Thank you very much!!!",1
"Hey Tina! I'm about to watch this video, after initially stumbling upon your video on the scoreboard. You're a really awesome person, and I really appreciate the effort you're putting into creating these videos. I haven't watched this current one yet, but it'd be great to hear what's changed over the year, if anything. I can already tell your editing and recording quality has improved a ton, and that's not a sleight. I'm excited to learn, thanks again!",1
"Thank you so much! I am so happy I found your channel. I am a software engineer, worked for 2 years. Now, I am willing to transition my career to data science. I am a person who try to go in-depth into a topic and due to which at some point I get overwhelmed and discouraged. Your videos  provided me great tips like study just what’s required and implement it. Also, you have given some resources to learn. Thank you! Please continue to share such more informative videos. I am going to stay tuned and also start teaching myself the skills to be a data scientist. Please wish me luck✌️ Thank you!",1
"Hi Tina! I'm a Sophomore studying in the UK and I was thinking of a path (Software Engineering, Cyber Security, Data Science) to follow for my career.  I was initially hesitant in trying to explore more on Data Science until I came across your video. Thank you very much for your insight! Anyways, I also reached out on LinkedIn :D - GY",1
"This video is soo good. The number 1(!) question I've had in moving into industry when I finish my PhD is ""how much do I need to know about X"" to get a job.

When you said ""variable declaration, loops and OOP"" - I was hooked.

Thanks so much for the vid, this was legit one of the most helpful vids I've found on this topic so far!",1
"This is my favorite channel. I especially like it when you explain everything so nicely. I wish you a lot of success with the channel and happy life. This is a great channel! I only caught sight of you folks in recent times, but it’s now among my favorite channels. Congratulations on such an amazing achievement, can't wait to see your channel grow even bigger.",1
You are idol for non tech background people who wants to career transaction towards IT. You actually understand our capabilities.  We love  you i always follow you. Keep going.,1
I m surprise how fast ur ....learning technology...and maintain consistency difficult for me.....but ur videos really helps....thanks,1
"I love the videos, Harry. Just a small correction, those insights role is usually that of  a Data Analyst or an Insight Solution Analyst. A Data Scientist's role is usually dependent on Statistics and applying the right ML models.",1
Beautiful explanation Harry bhai! Highly recommended for all students and even beginner professionals! Harry Bhai ke videos are one of the best sources of knowledge,1
"Hello Harry bhai, please make a series on MATLAB and their features like simulink, stateflow and autocode generation. It's very important in automotive/automobile industry. If do you have any material or Video series/link please share with us. And again thanks Harry bhai for your efforts. Thank you.",1
Please complete the Data structures and algorithms series ! 🙏🏻 Please Harry bhaiya,1
"Hi, I am from non-t ech field so I found myself interested in this data science programme and also started watching your videos and practicing. But I have a question that it would be valid learning from YouTube only and not from any learning institute for getting job in future?",1
"Hi all ~ expecting some questions so linking this q&a for your reference! https://youtu.be/C_PH8PdtZsE

Will also be taking & collecting questions on Instagram so let’s connect there 🥰 https://instagram.com/julia.fei?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=",1

"“I’ve learned that if you want to learn something new in the workplace, you’ve really have to seek it yourself!” The truth in those words 🙌🏽",1
"I got my first job on a data science team for this summer and have been super nervous about it and living alone. Your videos have been extremely inspiring and encouraging, and I feel less anxious and more excited for this summer. Thank you Julia!!",1
"I'm so excited to see something like this in my future. I'm a college freshman in CS with an emphasis on AI/ML and Data Science. I can't wait to hopefully have a nice life like this. I do know that you can't see everything through the lens of a camera so I'll be sure to not let this dilute the difficulties you've been through to get to where you are today!

Edit : First year of college is over! Time to hone up on new skills and do my best to get past stage two of internship interviews! :) Though I am a freshman, not impossible, but most have been no’s. Always next year!",1
"I'm a junior SE and loved your vlog! I think you hit on something at the end: ""it's just a job."" I used to glamorize the tech industry, but I'm starting to see that the work is not always innovative and transformative...sometimes it's literally just a job lol..Keep up the good work and can't wait to see more ""day in the life"" vlogs!",1
"Julia, é tão inspirador e tranquilizante assistir seus vídeos! Parabéns por sua dedicação =)",1
Please continue to make your videos Julia! They’re so relaxing and inspiring and I look forward to them each week. I can’t believe you can do so much in one day!,1
Thanks for motivating me. I've been feeling so burned out lately. You amaze me how you can go through so many meetings yet still have the feeling to do editing.,1
A vlog by Julia on a Friday is the perfect way to wrap up the work week!!!,1
Somehow I am more comfortable with Indian professors than that with others. Great contain delivered by highly experienced professors.,1
Excellent material for simple understanding of the basic concepts! Thank you for sharing this material and making it available for free!!,1
I have done ML course from UpGrad but now when I see these videos they are amazing. The professors had made it so easy to understand. I regret why I didn't join Great Learning instead. Anyways thanks for sharing these videos. Please do share more videos. Great Learning really have great professors. Also if there is any short term courses of 1-2 month which explain all these things in one place it would be great.,1
Need more topics to cover by this amazing professor.,1
"Such a great teaching style with practical knowledge of industry, statistics and programming. By combining all these surely we are going to delighted.
Thank you great learning for uploading such great content.",1
"Indian Professors always makes things easier to understand atleast my experience is that , loved the way he teaches",1
Both professors are exceptionally gifted at understanding and communicating this beautiful subject.,1
"excellent coaching, the tutor is great.......................Thank you for this course",1
Amazing explanations!,1

"Thank you very much for this video! 
Please note:  reinforcement learning is not the semi-supervised learning !!! semi-supervised learning is a mixture of supervised and unsupervised methods. but reinforcement learning is a more complex and challenging method to be realized, but basically, it deals with learning via interaction and feedback.",1
I would like to thank all the YouTube teachers for explaining the topics crystal and clear.,1
"Thanks Krish! I was looking for a video that could clarify the differences between AI, MC, DP and Data science, and after looking all around youtube i found your video. It was awesome! I'm looking forward your next videos.
Hugs from Brazil 🇧🇷",1
Finally a good explanation that doesn't hide confusion behind jargon. Thanks!,1
"Hi Krish, I have always been interested in AI and things around it & about it. You nailed it, man! A naive like me who has some faint idea of AI could simply understand and know further about DL & ML too! Very useful video. Thanks much! :)",1
"Hai Sir, 
Thank you for this video. I dont know even a single alphabet in this subject when compared to  all other viewers. But now a days I hear a lot about Artificial intelligence, ML, DL & DS  around me. So I thought to at least know what they mean. I struck the correct video at the first attempt and I put your lecture in white and black which came to 2 pages while viewing and hearing . The lecture was so crystal clear that me who does not have any knowledge in software (I just use word & XL for my job) has come to know about the above 4 subjects to the extent what you delivered. If I have understood, then the people who are already in this subject  would have got a lot of useful information. Now If I tell to my son who works for a software company about this subject he may feel surprised that how I could knew about this subject. Thanking your Sir once again. I am 57yrs old, can I learn and become DE or DA or DS",1
currently watching as the quarantine period is in process and this helped me understand. Thank you for this amazing explanation! <3 <3,1
I am a Structural Engineer. This is a good field for data science since most civil engineers don't learn programming/coding and when they do they just shift to IT industry. Data science will be very crucial for monitoring the life of structures.,1
Thank you professor for giving such crucial information. How about MIS (Management in Information Systems) for MS in USA. Does even that has the same supply-demand ratio problem? or is it safe bet to pursue masters in that field? Throw some light on it professor!!,1
"Thank you for this video, I am going for a Ph.D. in Business Data Science and was wondering what steps I can take to make sure that I can be successful in this field. I have worked as a Data Scientist in Fintech companies in India for 2 years and now going forward with my Graduate Studies. Your videos have been very inspirational.",1
"Thank you for the information! I am going for a Ph.D. in Geospatial Data Science. I have experience in programming and have a background in Remote Sensing and GIS. As you talked about finance and  banking, I would like to know your opinion on the careers in the Geospatial industry if we have data science skills.  I would be glad to hear back from you. :)",1
"Thanks a lot sir. I'm struggling in making a decision upon data science, AI and cybersecurity. I'm currently in network engineering field. I initially thought of doing a masters in cybersecurity or data science. As I felt that AI would conquer the cybersecurity and data  in future, I'm searching for an explaination. You explained very well sir. Could you please tell whether there would be opportunities for those who have switched the carrier to AI field? Much merits to you sir from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰",1
المختصر المفيد فعلا ♥️ شكرا ليكي ي نوررر♥️♥️♥️,1
I think most of the folks(experienced ones) already know what you are suggesting. I was expecting some good advices in terms of applying for the jobs through LinkedIn & other portals from India. USA is close to impossible to get into directly from india but european countries are still open for the direct jobs. It would be great if you could throw some light on that route,1
"Always thanks for the great vidoes! What do you think about ""Statistics"" Master's degree? If I follow up coding skills by myself, will I get opportunities to work for the big IT companies?",1
"Hello sir u r one of the best teacher for data science for me , sir i would like to know that if I want to join a company abroad for remote internships and ppo what will be the good options so i can learn also and get to know the market also at the same time having hands on experience..",1

Loved this session sir ! Ur really good at explaining! Spot on  I feel so good and confident,1
Thank you for making statistics more interesting with your examples :),1
"Fantastic session , wish i would be there in live session . Now I am getting intrested in data science due to statistics. Thanks you lot for providing this .",1
You are doing an excellent job. Free education is more appreciable which needs a good heart. Thank you for your great service.,1
Thanks for watching! What does your data science path looks like?,1
Thanks for the shout out Sundas! Great video!,1
"Hi Sundas, great video. I am trying to make a switch from operations to analytics and I learned Excel and Tableau first and then learnt to code. Completely agreed that knowing the tool isn’t enough. You gotta be a pro to make them believe you have what it takes.",1
"Thanks for the video Sundas!  I still struggle to know what data science role I want to do. I'd love to hear more of your thoughts on picking direction when you don't yet have experience. There's a big gap between the skills I have now and some of the positions I am interested, but I'm hoping that I can still move around in the field as I learn more.
My data science journey started last year during the pandemic when I was locked out of my PhD lab and needed to do something productive.
My process so far
1. Data Science in R series from Harvard on Edx
2. Reading practical statistics for data science with a bookclub
3. Python programming course
Pre4. Learned some linear algebra, calculus 
4a. ML course
4b. Data science fellowship with DS4A
Now. Learning SQL online!
Always. Engage in DS community and attend talks to learn about various topics
Next. Applied Machine learning class to do some project work and also I should  finish my PhD this semester!!",1
It's so greatfull of you Sundas mam to mentor us gracefully. I'm just 18 but see my future as data scientist and always get many more to learn from u . Mam please keep motivating students like me and others as well . need more videos on data scientist.,1
Hi Sundas! I am a chemical engineer working in industrial automation for several years. I spent several years drawing conclusions from tons of process trendings and doing data visualization (when I I didn't know what it really was) until I found your IG and that's when I knew I was into data analytics. I am doing the Google data analytics certificate course and it is great so far. I am also hesitating to stepping into the data scientist role but I will see how the data analytics goes first. Thanks for inspiring me to give my career a new direction !( Changing at 35 is not easy!),1
"Thanks so much for clearing it out. I am learning data science on my own. I started learning statistics few months ago, almost done. I was a little confused and restless if i made the right choice by learning statistics first. I read a lot of comments on quora where people said that coding should be the first step, it didn't make much sense to me. Now its all clear and i have gained confidence after watching your video. I have a similar road map to what you just said. Thanks so much for inspiring and giving us so much info. All the best and really looking forward to watch your future videos.",1
"Thank you so much for this ideas.
You are very correct and I got to know that as it fell in line with the structure of Datacamp schedule where I am learning Data Science now. I also appreciate you for mentioning Kaggle because I have been thinking where or how can I implement the little I have learnt.
Well done 👍",1
Check my new video where I made a Metroidvania using Microsoft Paint only https://youtu.be/Rz-Sk9gJmhg ! It’s pretty EPIC.,1
"Quite a lot of progress for 1 year, congrats and keep learning!",1
"Woah, truly got surprised to see this channel with 2.5k subs. The editing and content was spectacular! Earned a sub from me! Excited to see what other content you’ll be coming out with!",1
Great editing brother. Had my attention the entire time!,1
"this video is really good, editing, voice over, creativity everything in every sense",1
"I'm most impressed by your animations honestly, very nice",1
"even your early games made more from boredom than interest are impressive... you learned so much game dev in a year, makes me feel more motivated to start in earnest.",1
"I started making game yday (second attempt here too, 1 year ago I tried and failed) and I'm so happy when I heard that what I'm going through is normal. Its really hard to stick to something nowadays and when you said something about making game simple so you don't quit I really felt that lmao. 

Anyways good luck on making GTA 6 in 2023 mate!",1
Really humorous and inspiring. Great stuff!,1
"This was a really interesting video! I've been toying around with the idea of making my own game after seeing Toby Fox and Eric Barone do it on their own, but I've always feared the learning process when I probably should have been excited for it.

On a side note, are you Dutch or Belgian? A lot of my favourite content creators have a similar accent to yours and I've taken note of how many content creators there are from these countries. 

Makes me wonder if certain culturally facilitated living standards leads to more content creators.",1
"Game dev in my head: I'm gonna make a hyper realistic level with amazing movement, combat and an adaptive AI
Game dev in reality: Help I've imported a mesh and crashed my computer",0
"This video is really good and legit. I do however want to point out that you can still accomplish huge things in game design on your own or with a small team this day in age. There are incredibly powerful tools available for cheap and even free. The learning process to build an entire game is long, and difficult. Especially if you're thinking of an rpg. In my experience, single player games can be done fairly simply with alot of knowledge and experience, multiplayer games are a stretch to even try(alone or with a small team). But don't let the reality beat you up. If you really really want something, you can make it happen. I've been making games with blender and unity for nearly 6 years, and have prototyped/concepted my own rpg 5 times. Only now in 2022, am i confident enough to build the official version. But I've done it. I've learned enough to make it happen, and you can too. (Knowing is one thing, then you have to put in the years of hard work that still exist to bring it to life). CREATION IS KING! NEVER GIVE UP!",1
"This is exactly why I respect game developers, I once made a simple arcade game with a bit of coding with C# and I swear I almost put a hole in my monitor because the code wasn't working the way I wanted it to. But when you finally do get the code to work... What you feel is almost indescribable",1
Games are the most complex type of media cause they take all aspects of creativity together,1
"Solo Dev here, and the part about marketing is totally true.  My game (SHAMELESS PLUG, LINK ON MY CHANNEL TRAILER) was a complex effort where I learned a lot about animation, music, and sound mixing.  Some seemingly simple things, like sound settings and zoom, took the longest during development, and when it was all over, people who played my game said it was pretty good, but it was hardly even seen by anyone.  The marketing thing was something I never considered, so it's going to be a focus with my next game.  I made a game, and this video was so incredibly accurate to my journey, learning how much work everything is and my scope was too big in places, and that I naively expected Steam to give me enough visibility to get the game out there.  If anyone's wondering how accurate this video is, the answer is somewhere around 120%

Great video too.  Editing was great and music was well chosen.",1
"My game, Arcadian Rift, is now available on Steam for Wishlisting! Please consider adding it <3
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1702630/Arcadian_Rift/",1
I think the best part of this video is that his advice can be used for more than just game development.,1
"The most important thing I took away from my programming professor is: if your code is doing the thing you intended it to, that's the right way to do it.
Don't get hung up on 'doing it the right way', you can always optimize later",1
"I love how you are being open to your community. This helps the community to feel engaged in your projects. 

Anyways, I feel like this advice of yours can really help me in what I need to do, so thanks! 
Hope you have a great day! 

_also, what if you release your pizzatime game to public? XD_",1
"honestly can't thank you enough for this, im just starting off picking an engine and while i'm going to be doing it solo a lot of this advice is helpful beyond just game development. Being a visual artist as well i can actually attest to how important the bit about isolation is, nothing gasses up your motivation like being able to cross pollinate ideas and support each other.",1
I am so excited to start my dev journey! Thankyou for the inspo,1
"One year?! Insane.. I'm gonna get there, 11 months to go :)",1
I feel more confident that i can actually learn gamedev knowing yanderedev made something that a lot of people enjoyed and he didn't even know most of the info in this video.,1
Can’t wait to make my first game for the airplane 😊,1
I've been a Dev for 3 years and have never had development explained in this way. I think this is one of the best development videos for beginners.,1
"Just what I needed to know to start making my first game, Call of Mario.",1
Such a great simplified yet essential breakdown!,1

"I really can agree with ""It increased my appreciation for those games"". Since ive got into game dev i know hoooow much work for exaple AAA games like Red dead 2 are.",1
"I just finished my first month of learning game dev with unity, and seeing this motivates me and excites me to see just how much I can learn in the next 2 months. Thanks for this video!",1
"Pre-optimisation is my biggest weakness as a sw engineer, it kills a lot of passion and motivation for projects if it’s not perfect. It’s very hard to correct!",0
Love how you added rpg maker As a Game engine There very underated But Very Amazing,1
"I'm not sure how I got recommended this from the Youtube Algorithm™, but I'm glad I did. After mindlessly eating half a box of cheez-its and finishing the video I was surprised to see the view count. The editing was great and I was thoroughly intrigued. I haven't seen any other of your videos but I hope you get one that blows up. You seem to be going in the right direction though, because I got recommended this video despite sparingly watching tech content. Best of luck.",1
"Thank you for making this. I fall into the trap of scheduling too, I’ve recently adopted your method of just working on it when I want to, it makes the Dev much more enjoyable! Using Monogame instead of Unity tho! Amazing video!😁",1
"“I thought it would ruin the magic of video games” if anything, it enhances it tenfold (for me anyway). I love thinking about how things could possibly be programmed whenever I’m playing a game. Sometimes I think of how I would tell a computer to complete daily tasks, like pouring a glass of water",1
"FinalBossBlues is awesome - I've been subscribed for ages for my own projects

And I know the number of tutorials isn't quite as high, but I would recommend Godot to 2D beginners - it's relatively clean and easy to pick up, completely open source, and less than 1GB (I think the Steam version is ~950MB, but the full package straight off the website is closer to 100MB, and yet still fully functional... so very quick and easy to try out). I really like GDScript (Pythonesque) and the scene heirarchy is pretty intuitive.

I admit I keep getting hung up on optimisation... not just because, like you,  I work in another development area during my day job, but because I want anything I make to be playable on a potato if possible... but it really slows down/halts my progress... need to shoulder my way through that, like you recommend.",1
Thankyou so much for your support over the last few weeks! Its honestly been so crazy! Also make sure you join the discord server: https://discord.gg/7eknEtp,1
"tbh this gives me inspiration, being someone who has wanted to make games since a very very young age, i have had the idea to make my own little studio called ""the crying arcade"" and im just now learning how to do stuff, seeing the amount of progress you made with just a moving cube, it genuinely gives me hope, it makes me feel like i have a chance, thanks man",1
"After 1 year in unity, I see you have improved so much, keep it up!
At this rate, you will hit 10K, 100K or even 1M!",1
That's great your history of creating video games is so interesting such motivation to start unity,1
"I really want to learn C# in unity, so this is definitely something to look up to.",1
"Your first games are actually very impressive
The problem I had and have rn is learning coding on unity there is now where to learn C##",1
The rate at which you're growing is amazing. You had 2K Subscribers 2 months ago and now you have over 30K. Wish you the best for the future of this channel!,1
"I am a complete beginner at game dev, and this vid really inspired me to keep going, so thanks for making this vid!",1
Hey man… keep up the good work! Your progress is amazing!,1
"Awesome video. Very inspiring! Just started my C# journey a while back and gonna be jumping in Unity soon, I hope I will be making as much progress as you did damn!",1
"Hi everyone! I realized I didn't actually describe my first role in the industry but it was essentially focused on monetization within games (that's why ethical monetization is my specialty now). So for sure, there's data analysis because we need to be comfortable with leveraging large amounts of data to make good decisions. It also encompasses monetization and systems design - though I wasn't formally trained in monetization design before joining (it's actually not a common designer specific skill so most of us learn this skill by joining the industry first). Monetization design encompasses things like battle passes, loot box designs, game ecoystem design (hard currency to soft currency, what resources are tradable and purchasable, etc.), designing events and seasons (what content should be available, how is it distributed, what does progression and rewards look like in an event, etc.) and ofc the pricing of it all. We also need to have business savvy because we need to lay out beforehand what success looks like and determine if the choices we make are good ones. We often look at things like player sentiment and satisfaction, purchase regret, MAU, revivals, etc to get a sense of this. 

My role today though focuses on a broader list of things, not just monetization but particularly engagement and retention as well! I made a video about what the responsibilities are so feel free to check that out :)",1
"This video was really inspiring and insightful to watch! Thank you for sharing your story and also the tip on “Skillset to Interest Framework”. I never thought of that idea, especially since I am someone who doesn’t necessarily know what roles I would be a best fit for, but also that matches my current skillset. Still in the process of exploration. Anyways, thank you for the video! :)",1
Great to hear your story! Was an amazing journey. Please use your smarts for good and make game monetization less predatory for all who play the games you work on. It's an incredibly important issue and I'm so happy to hear that people are thinking about and specializing in work like that.,1
"Hi Morgan! Just want to tell you that I really loved the ""Skillset to Interest"" Framework. It really did a good job. I'm not a game-related worker but this thing helps me up to retrospect my career skill set. Thanks for making this video!",1
"Loved this video! There are so many videos that just say ""do this, this and you'll eventually get into the industry"", but you managed to break your journey down into a series of manageable steps. Looking forward to seeing more content from you!",1
"Only halfway into the video. The way of breaking down the job roles within the industry has been immensely helpful and information friendly to new gamers, designers or hopefuls wanting to join the game industry.",1
"It's a very informative video and it's genuinely interesting to hear your journey. On the other hand, the title is definitely a clickbait. The video has very little to do with how to become a developer. Rev analyst is not a developer, nor is the product manager role.",1
"Morgan this is awesome! One, because I love league of legends (been playing since like season 6) and it's just amazing to see people that have a vision for their life, plan, work hard to achieve it and succeed. I'm one of those as well. Got a degree in Neuroscience/Psychology. Fell in love with web dev. Learned the skills that I needed, and been working as a web dev for about 6 months, and life has been a dream ever since!",1
You have achieved more in 2 years that a whole team of people in 3. Absolutely phenomenal,1
Congrats on two years of exciting development! Incredibly inspiring.,1
Congrats man on your 2 years! You're a legend!,1
"Dude honestly this just looks amazing and I think it's simply inspiring to see someone make this possible. It means we could do it as well, maybe, if we work as hard as you :)",1
"I remember seeing your first devlog 2 years ago and just knowing it wasn't going to be another one of those indie games that devs drop after a few months and boy was i right. I haven't seen a more polished amazing looking well thought out fun indie game in my entire life and i don't think i will ever see anything like this again. If i was you i would be extremely proud of myself for making something as cool as this and same goes to everyone who helped you. I cannot wait to be able to play this but i cant even wait to see these dev logs at the end of each month. Awesome work keep it up and best of luck!

17:40 Also i think these humanoid characters will really go far in this game even if they arent enemies, and no matter how hard they are to animate i really think its going to make your game stand out from traditional indie games as if it doesn't enough! Also to whoever concepted the humanoid characters awesome job! Looks dope!",1
"Noice. Congrats on 2 years, the concept art for enemies and missions is looking sick... and I'm excited for what the future holds. ❤",1
"I've been watching since the start. this is the best devlog ever, and I can't wait till it's done!",1
"Bro this is genuinly nuts, an inspiration to a lot of us . The amount you have got done and learned in 2 years is crazy, good job!",1
It's absolutely nuts that this is your *first* game project and it looks so promising already. Just imagine what you'll be able to do in the future if this one is a success,1
"I didn't know Mark is such a pretty good artist! those art concepts and sprites for his old game ideas looks really nice, I always thought the phase of Prototype is always super important to make sure if a game is gonna be good, I think is possible to already have [these characters and this music and this story] if that's the goal of a game, still I can see how game design can evolved those concepts into something more fitting for whatever the gameplay can be.",1
I'm the dev who integrated 2D physics into Unity and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this. I think I'll be going into the attic to dig out my folder of ideas from my youth too!,1
"Reminds me of the first semester of my game design masters, we had a course that was just making a game, in groups of 5. After week 1 of ""production"" everyone presented their current state and this one game just looked amazing. I felt so jealous of how quickly they got their game looking so beautiful, but when the proffessor was giving feedback he asked ""why does it look so pretty?"" as a critique for this exact reason. He seemed almost mad they made things so pretty so early, because it was too early too tell if their idea worked, yet they had spent time making it look amazing.",1
"GMT: ""Don't over think or over prepare your game""
Me, with adhd and wanting to make a metroidvania style game: *visible sadness*",0
"I really recommend you checking out a book “The Art of Game Design” and it’s chapter about prototyping. It really nicely explains the purpose of prototypes and that even though your first prototype answered your question of “Is there a potential in this design?” it’s a good idea to create more prototypes which are going to help you answer more questions about uncertain things before you settle on something and go into full production mode.

Great video. I think more people should know this stuff.",1
"To summarize: if you don't make a cheap and fast prototype for your game, then your game is an overdeveloped prototype. And good luck with that!",1
"TLDR: Mark learned to “FOCUS ON THE PRIMARY LOOP”. 

Looks amazing already Mark!  :)",1
"Another really important aspect of prototyping is learning whether you actually ENJOY game design or not. If you're having more fun coming up with the story, setting, lore, and themes than you are experimenting with gameplay ideas, then chances are you're more into worldbuilding than game design. Learning this early can help steer you towards your strengths and interests.",1
"Hey man, I've been building these, let's call them ""prototypes"" for many years. I'm a programmer and game designer (and always wanted to be ever since a kid and been following that passion since ye old newground days), but when it comes to art I just shut down. I'm genuinely awful at the art part. So I've always teamed up with artists. Problem is I then get bogged down with the project management aspect and art pipeline systems instead of the art that it's wildly impacted my focus on the gameplay aspect, and it suffers as a result. Eventually everyone burns out and the project peters off for something new and shiny using what we've learned. 
I know this stupid vicious cycle well.",0
"Now that Mark knows how to make games, he can take part in the GMTK Game Jam, one of the biggest Game Jams ever",1
I’m so grateful that you focused on the “boring stuff” in this video. It was very illuminating. Thanks!,1
"Here is my feedback:

-I totally got the eureka moments in every level
-It will be easier to automatically grab de magnet
-I got softlocked many times so the restart was nice. I dunno if it will be better for players to get less stuck than the reset
-Initially I thought I should return to the key hub, that made me feel as if the level endings were anticlimactic
-I'll love to move while aiming, it feels more fluent
 -The key as a concept and progress tracker is nice but I don't know how well it fits in the game. The doors weren't like the key type so it doesn't make sense to open them with it, also it's kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe... maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better
-Maybe it will be nice if the polarity affects the magnet character, for example making the positive smile and the negative sad
-The main character could shine more while aiming, maybe a subtle movement in the eyes following the aim

Overall I loved it and am really thankful that it was free for everyone so I could try it ♥",1
"Imagine being talented and dedicated enough to not just make a game on your own, but also make a high quality video series detailing your design processes at the same time! Really amazing stuff!",1
"""And so I abused my internet fame to get someone much smarter than me to build that exact thing I just described""
fantastic line 
😅",0
"love this series, I'll admit I was a little sceptical when you changed things on your channel but I am really enjoying this, maybe even more than the video essay type videos

I was about to start making my first game my “dream game”. Glad I saw this and now I’m gonna get a few small games under my belt before my dream game.,1
"I started my 2D platformer when I was just starting to learn Unity and C#. I ended up taking a break to make a smaller game; a 2D bullet hell shooter called HyperShot. I put it on Steam, and I still get a sale now and then. Now I'm almost finished my platformer, which will be on Steam next year.",1
"Hey, glad to see this, I'm about to start making my first game. Thomas always has the best advice",1
"These are some amazing tips and the one about not doing everything from scratch really made me realize how much time I'm wasting.
As for games I worked on a game for most of last year and now that I look back on it I made a lot of mistakes mostly related to planing but I did find out I am much better at programming and designing systems than actually making art plus I learned a lot about the type of games I am mostly good at making",1
"Your tip about knowing your forte really resonated with me. I too pride my self in character building and story telling. Those are my passions what keeps me making my game. This being my first game you’re other tip was perfect, I should make a small short game before putting my all into my dream story / dream game. This video hit at the perfect time for me, and thank you for your content. One question about your stories, do you have them all laid out first before you start building your games or do you kind of build the story and the small details of the story as you go, drawing inspiration from some of your worlds and art?",1
I did release my own game on iOS about ten years ago. It was the only personal project I ever released. I outsourced all the creative assets just to save myself time. Crossing the finish line with this stuff is very challenging. I totally agree making your crap game first is the way to go. Great video!,1
I really enjoy these tip type videos Thomas. They are really motivating. I have my first small-sized project game in mind and it motivated me to not b afraid of using assets if needed. Thanks for being motivating. Proud to be part of the gamedev community. :),1
"Cool video, I always enjoy seeing game developer improvement over time. Keep going!",1
Bro this is awesome!!! Keep up the good work man! Ik that your work will shine at one point😄🤩,1
Keep up the good work!,1
Awesome stuff!,1
"Cool video! Keep making the content, its very fun to watch! Though it does keep me of from doing my homework.. Oh and um… make a game for ios next? :s",1
Well done,1
Really good video it’s similar to mine but better! lol!,1
Thanks for the insight,1
Super underrated video and now I got inspired to make a gta clone too,1
Actually underrated,0
Can't wait until the game releases! :),1
"I love your videos and happened upon then through my recommended feed. By showing all of your thought processes going into your designs and wealth of knowledge of architecture, your passion made me want to support you and Chef RPG through Kickstarter. I can't wait to see the final product and finally hop into the world you created 😁",1
"The game has a really nice identity, I'm happy to contribute to it, Noah manages our project wonderfully and Nikita impresses me since the beginning with his pixel art. 😎",1
"I really like the path this game is going towards, the world looks and feels alive yet captivatingly out of this world. I would love to help you in a way, English and Turkish are my primary languages, so you can reach to me if you need any translation work to Turkish in the future, since that's all I can do :))",1
OOOH ! IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE THE NEW IN-WORLD CHARACTER'S SPRITES ! also some of the latest decors look soo insane ♥️ you and clement did such a great job 😄,1
"The new character sprites look so good! Seems like you’ve come so far in such a short amount of time. With the amount of detail and complexity in not only the art, but the code, I assumed you were a seasoned game designer and programmer when I saw your 1st devlog almost 2 years ago. I was impressed then and even more so now watching Chef RPG progress and improve as you continue to grow as an artist and game developer. It’s not only fun but incredibly inspiration for the rest of us indie game dev. I can’t wait for the next update!",1
"The complexity throughout blows me away. There's enough going on in a single indoor restaurant screen to make a fixed screen game out of that. Instead, you're making a game with loads more to explore and do. The amount of generosity it takes to make this much content is what I love most and is just as difficult to achieve as making a great game in the first place.",1
"omg the new character sprites look fantastic!! the combination of someone with architectural experience, a character artist and a sprite artist sounds very powerful",1
love the thought that went to this game's design and the improvments and overall progress you made thus far. really glad i was able to back this project.,1
Respect for all your hard work bro. The game looks so amazing. modern day art!,1
You guys should get a world wide credit for any improvements in the field of CSE in upcoming years. Thank you for giving us these things for free.,1
"I'm only two hours in and I feel like my brain is swelling and going to burst out of my eye sockets, ears, nose, and mouth from all the pure knowledge you're giving me. Thank you. This is the tutorial I was looking for. You're actually teaching me the terms and functions and what they mean, and not just teaching me how to copy text. Thank you.",1
"this just shows how good youtube can be for teaching, several one hour long lessons compressed into a single video for everyone to watch for free no matter where you are",1
"Thank you so much. This teacher is the best teacher from a tutorial I've ever had. Clear, entertaining, and easy to follow. Well done.",1
For beginners like me this is pure gold bb thanks for posting your vids!!,1
I know it's corona times but look at all the resources that are available for free. what a time to be alive love it,1
"OMG, you don't know how thankful I am for this tutorial. I've been trying to find a tutorial that explains every single thing in a line of code for me for so long! Thank you so much!",1
"Very good tutorial ! Even if this tutorial is one year old, I'd like to add something. For the inheritance, I think it would've been worth mentioning the ""Protected"" accessibility level for variables. For those that don't know, a Protected variable is the same as a private one, except that the variable will be treated as if it was public for the child classes. It's pretty useful in cases like the one shown in this video.",1
7 hours of free  content actually teaching you something and for free. Thank you!,1
"I wanted to thank you so much for this tutorial! I'm a total beginner and everything is explained so well and in a pleasant pace. Also I'm very thankful for the nice structuring of the video, which really helps going back and finding the topics that you need easily. Thanks a lot for your effort, it really is helpful!",1
Fantastic game with seemingly endless potential. Other games in this genre feel outdated in comparison. Impressive for EA release.,1
"31:50 I really like the name Sapiens that you landed on. Because that name isn't JUST prehistoric humans. It is a game about Sapiens. It could be prehistoric, medieval, modern, future, or anything.

Because of this you aren't stuck with only cavemen. It can go as far as you want and the modders want.",1
I’m addicted to this game!!! You gave me the game I’ve wanted for years! Thank you 🙏🏾,1
"I discovered this project literally a few hours ago, and now just minutes ago you upload a video discussing launch! I have missed so much, but I’m very much looking forward to release!",1
"Been playing this game for the last week and it's brilliant! I'd love to see some sort of interaction with Rivers and the ""terraforming"" that can be used to create Sapien-Made Canals and such! Looking forward to the future updates 🙂",1
"Your reaction to the release at the end with your family was so fucking wholesome. 
Congrats! You are living the game dev dream",1
It’s been an amazing journey to follow ! Absolutely crazy to think I was just 9 when you started work on this— congrats on the early access launch !! :D,1
Been one heck of a ride watching this project for the past few years and finally seeing it come together! You've made something really special and I wait to see where you go from here!,1
"Following the development of Sapiens has been a lot of fun, I hope the game continues beeeing developed for a long time
And really, well done making the game (its amazing) and pushing through past the honeymoon period of the development process",1
"Hey everyone, instead of the normal devlogs I put together this short summary of how I got into gamedev. I hope this is interesting and if you haven't already, consider subscribing :) The next video will be a normal devlog again.",1
"As a software engineer I'm doing everything the exact oposite way you are :D The code being the easy part and graphics being the hard part...  You are really artistically talented, love to follow your devlogs!",1
"Super inspiring, I'm about a year and a half into my learning and it makes me feel a lot better about abandoning projects.",1
"Amazing how much history and experience goes into what looks like a relatively simple game. You make it look so easy, but it’s so much more than meets the eye",1
"6 years, that's incredible! Loved hearing about how you started, think it's quite interesting to see how you love for drawing/modelling got you into making games :)",1
"That's awesome. Looks like it was a long journey but you've learned a lot! I'm currently on about my 15th overly-ambitious, doomed project but I hope I can finish something decent soon.",1
"I just want to appreciate the amount of effort you've put into making actual projects. I often find myself just fiddling around with ideas in my head and not making any project myself. I feel that has been a limiting factor in my learning. But this video has been super inspirational. 

I have been wanting to make my own devlog series but I was not able to stick to a project long enough. Till now, I have been wanting to make devlogs and work on a small project for a timeline of 3 months. And just finish a full game. 
Any tips to just stick to it?",1
"Absolutely loved seeing some of the old insect designs, super cool stuff!",1
I've been struggling to get anywhere with my project. I'm glad you haven't given up and I love the asthetic and ideas you have for your current project. Don't give up!,1
Your progress over the years is astounding. This new game you've been working on looks amazing and is just the sort of game I would love to play. I hope you keep at it.,1
"Quite inspiring story, I think most of us would be definitely interested in getting to hear a 2nd part of your journey.",1
"As as a Games student in my first year of college, this has really inspired me to keep pushing myself. Keep it up mate!!",1
Congrats!,1
"I've just started working at the game industry after studying gamedev too and it's amazing that I can see myself in your story :)
(Although I don't work for a AAA studio, but time will tell)",1
"I'm 40 years old just finally starting to getting round to learning programming and unity, completely new to it but really enjoy watching these types of videos, gives me more motivation, I'll probably never learn as much as you would have going to uni and stuff, but it's all fun and learning. even if I just make some shitty 2D games, that'll be cool haha",1
"I've been working in game dev for 4.5+ years and it seems the best job offers comes not from HRs / tech interviewers / skill evaluations, but the people that just understand what exact people they need in their team and just invite you over. At least from my experience in east Europe. 

Also, when comparing your UK College/University experience to what we have in east Europe, you are in a intergalactic space age.",1
A friend recommended this video to me to inspire me to work harder on my course in level 3 games design. From level 2 i figured it'd be quite easy but damn i was mistaken. This video has fully inspired me to push more and research more of my course! So thank you for this 1 year journey it was very inspiring and keep it up!,1
Amazing story. Makes me regret wasting so much time during collage when I knew I wanted to develop my game dev skills.,1
"As a person who is still in school, knows no coding language other than html and css, very interested in game design, favourite game being Sea of Thieves. Just, mind-blowing",1
You still have clapped British teeth.,0
"Already 2 years of putting everything together,  it looks like a proper game,   good job",1
"Wow, it has been a journey, good job on the 2 years of progress, I reckon this game is going to a banger",1
Congratulations on 2 years of game dev awesome progress over the years,1
Man this is so exciting! I can’t wait to see what this game will be about. I’m also starting my game dev journey and you’re my motivation fuel! Keep grinding and i hope the best for your future!,1
Its amazing how far this project has gone. This is really a main inspiration for why I have picked up Game development again.,1
I look forward to more game dev content!,1
"This game is incredible, good work 🇧🇷",1
"this really did have a vibe of a professional youtube video, i've really enjoyed the editing style. Keep rockin' in the free world!",1
"Keep it up bro youll blow up like this, i love your humor and editing and also your story is so cool, i am excited about your game",1
"*...along with 200 employees of course!* LOL
That's a really good point I just want to tell those who come up like *hey so im basically making gta 5 in unity, and ill release it on steam next week*",1
"Fun cheats:
-In Bioshock, when the player recieves lethal damage, he gets a few seconds of god mode, leading to more ""barely survived"" moments.
-In Gears of War, the last bullet in a magazine deals 3x damage, leading to more ""barely defended myself"" moments.",0
Coding your own games is easier than you think... skip ad,1
"I love how when he was talking about the importance of the player's role, that when he said ""just running around doing tasks for the sake of it"" he showed CoD footage.",1
I'm doing ict in highschool and our teacher showed us this video in class. I find game design very interesting and I wish to pursue it in the future. I just wanted to thank you for making informative and entertaining content like this. You're inspiring people to take up game making.,1
"It's so great to see you talk about game design, I really think you should make a separate video about each one of those themes. I see a lot of developers that know how to make games but don't really know how to make them fun, and if you can teach them that, you'll be one step ahead of pretty much every channel like yours.",1
"Great video!

It may be overwhelming for someone just starting out. But actually, you are not saying that we have to be expert on all of these, but mentioning important aspects of each. For example, the part of rules and the events in the game was great, and even though it seems obvious, i never thought about that. I don't make games myself though, but i find game making incredibly interesting, and difficult.",1
Thank you brackeys ive had so much trouble with designing my own games thanks for sharing your knowledge with everyone.,1
You give great tips and info that are worth so much more than the time you spend making them. Please keep up the great work and we will all keep watching.,1
The first game is Wonder and so well polished. Imagine if it was released in 90s it would've wiped the market,1
"All these games seem pretty good, but the first is definitely my favourite. The second game looks nice enough, however the gameplay looks rather bland.",1
"the first game is awesome
the second one just did what you wanted him to but nothing more
the third one was quite cool but a bit boring, also is horror game material
the fourth game looked like if it was made by a 10 year old but still cool",1
"Based on their Fiverr pages the first game appears to have cost $25, the second $35, third $5, and last one is listed at $30. I would have to say #1 was easily the best investment.",1
"The first game could end up being successful with proper funding and development. I love the idea of the recoil that launches you. Imagine that they added bosses, multiplayer, etc.",1
"The first one definitely felt more varied and had more to it, compared to the others. Which, they DID do what they were requested, but the other 3 just looked...generic in a way? While the first had enemies with AI that would attack you, interesting level design, and the movement and gunplay had more personality to them(being able to move the gun in any direction, using recoil to jump/lift off the ground), as well as different types of guns to play with. I guess it just had more polish to it, compared to the others too.",1
The developer of the first game is sick 🤯... Great game!,1
"The first game was a really clever reference to no time to explain, with very similar mechanics, and pretty much the same genre",1
"Been in game development at least 14yrs now, I literally lost track. Greatest advice given here is to target a niche and do something special: platformers and zombie games are a dime a dozen. Pick out something unique that's cool, maybe something that no one has done in many years. That's how Stardew Valley blew up on Steam.",1
"Tip #1 can’t be stressed enough, I spent my first year learning courses on coursera and udemy, thinking I’d get into game design once I’m “ready”. That day never came, no matter what I learned I never felt ready yet. Then one day I just started working on my project and said I’d learn new things where I needed to. Honestly doing things this way made me progress faster than any course ever has",1
"Not sure if it's mentioned in this video, but something I feel should be said in every tips video like this:

DON'T DO YOUR DREAM PROJECT FIRST

You will ruin it, if you don't give up first",0
"The tip I see missing from all of these videos is: Take inspiration from *wide* sources. Not just your favorite games. What's the GOOD in the game you otherwise hate? What do you like about that book you just read? How can you incorporate colour like they do in that movie you watched?

This is what they mean when they say ""Good artists copy, great artists steal"". When you steal something you *make it your own*, and if you steal from a diverse set of inspirations, it becomes truly yours.",0
"You didn't waste those 2 years. You learned so much. You did so many things. These things add up in the future. We think we can learn everything in YT videos, but experiencing it firsthand gives you a much deeper understanding of things",1
"Shaders were super intimidating, but I spent a weekend learning them, and am so glad I did it. I feel pretty fluent in them not even a week later, and have been using them nonstop. I needed to use them for one effect, but the applications where shaders are useful keep appearing. It’s definitely a tool worth having in your arsenal. And like visual scripting vs actual coding, being able to write your own shaders allows you to do performance things you wouldn’t be able to do with visual scripting a shader.",1
"Imo something that's Extremely underrated, especially for programmers is learning to use programming design patterns early on. Observer pattern is a MUST for game dev with larger projects. Having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects, and it makes your code more modular (each class/game object is its own self contained thing). Singleton and Factory patterns, as well as SOLID principles are also good to look into. Factory less so for Unity since you can use GetComponent to retrieve references for things. If you're using Unity, learn to use Unity events/C# events and you will make your code a lot cleaner and save time on large projects.",1
"I am still alive lol
It's going to take some more time, but more devlogs will *actually* be coming!
Also, thanks for the crazy amount of support - it means a lot!",1
"I've watched this video a bunch of times, it really is SO good. Only just realised I wasn't subbed!",1
"I would actually play this game for hours, keep going!",1
"actually, i have a plenty good options for the game.

those options are:
- player has 200 health points
- the turret has a field of view / a.i. (if it sees the player, it'll shoot.)
- health and power pickups
- airborne / aerial targets (such as drones, heavy gunner drones, scout drones, etc.)
- ground targets (such as beam-shooting mechs, enemy balls (similar to the player but a little bit dumb), and laser artilleries.)
- the tank can destroy the turret (since the tank has the same weapons as the turret, but it has significantly high damage on every shot from the tank.)
- grenade-type weapons and projectiles (i meant by that which has new weapons to choose, such as full-auto grenade launcher with a very low rate of fire, or just a single-shot grenade launcher, similar to the M79.)
- the shield can spawn by using a shield powerup :)
- the player can shut down the turret's system

i hope this guy would see this :)",1

This is one of the most inspiring videos I've ever watched. Thank you so much for this. I'm new to the game design space and one of my biggest hurdles has been feeling overwhelmed about my lack of coding experience. Seeing your journey of how you went from no coding experience to being able to code a game by yourself at your first game jam really did something for me.,1
"As a gamedev who uses construct 3, this is really inspiring!",1
"This is lovely to hear how you found a whole community and amazing that you spent so long persistently making stuff, especially over a year of daily art. I just discovered Core, but didn’t realise it’s a creation tool, I haven’t loaded it up yet and they described it more as an arcade full of games. I’ve had an idea for a cat game for ages since I got three kittens last year and they’re hilarious, I don’t suppose there’s a basic cat model to edit. I draw and paint some, but the oomph goes too easily, I just got back into gaming after a while and you saying ‘I was a bored artist’ resonated. I’ve been wanting to do more with characters I was writing a story for too, heck I even learned code a few years ago, but my passion for websites waned and I found I didn’t love battling all my errors enough to keep going. So this all seems fun 😁",1

I do have a question. How are you creating your buildings within your world? I just started creating my own top down game with tilemaps and have encountered numerous issues creating buildings with tilemaps. I noticed that in the beginning of this video you are making buildings with the tiles that looks like a different program. Are you having better success utilizing that method of creating your world?",1

"Completely agree with your points in mutation 1. I am twice as good at coding/developing as I was last month, and I have the urge to go back and fix things that I no longer deem ""worthy"". However, I got to the point where I realized that just because I am better at in my craft, doesn't mean that my old features are bad. Sometimes simplicity is key! I think its about finding the right balance. 😁
Thank you again for sharing your insights Thomas! 🍻🕹",1

"4:54 Totally agree with writing readable code, I just don't think && and ! are the problem at all, in my opinion, if someone sees that as ""hard to read"" they should probably take a step back. I think bad/inconsistent indentation, confusing variable names, repeated code and organization in general are way greater problems that beginner coders do very often.",0
These were lesson's I had to learn the hard way over my four years of development. Thanks for getting this crucial tips out there for people starting out!,1
"My unofficial Tip 26:
Comment your code. It makes it _SO_ much easier to fix bugs or change things when you can see what pieces of code serve which purposes.",1
"Great vid! On the ""controversial"" tip, I agree keep your code readable! But I'd argue this is more about naming properties and functions, and not cramming too much on one line. Replacing !variable with variable == false leans towards being overly verbose to me (I would read !variable as ""not variable"" personally), but whatever makes it easier for you to understand your own code when coming back to it",1
"On that readable code tip (#24), I'd refine that to say ""make sure you can read your own code."" In a game I'm currently working on, I've added some variables that I could very easily get away without using. The only reason I have them is because they make my code cleaner and easier to work with.
Also, make sure you can understand your own code and follow exactly what it does line by line. It is a good idea to create some model or system to define how your code will work, and stick to that model unless an adjustment is absolutely necessary. To that end, I will create empty methods if that's how my model works.",1

"The first game felt like a flash game, the second felt like a full release, and the third felt like one of those Unity games with fun physics.

"yo, this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was, so I feel like I should clear a few things up.

First off, to game devs who are just starting out: don't attempt to do exactly what I did, because it probably won't work out well. And I'm not saying this because I think I'm smarter or better at game dev than you. In all honesty, I'm pretty average and tons of people could've done a lot better in my shoes. But that's just the thing, not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that I had. Prior to this I'd been making 2D games and was quite familiar with coding, so carrying that over to Unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple. I mentioned this in the video, but I've seen too many comments in the vein of ""wow this was impressive, I would never be able to do this"" which frankly makes me feel a little bad, since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience I had and I don't want to discourage anyone who doesn't realize this. 

So I just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2D games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions. Also, everyone learns at their own pace in their own way, and the rate at which that gets done doesn't really matter as long as you're able to learn what you needed to learn in the end (within reason of course, if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print ""hello world"", then we might have a problem). So even if you have as much experience as I did, there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time. Because ultimately, it doesn't really matter how quickly you're able to learn how to make games. As a game developer, you develop games, and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about, not how quickly you can make them. Of course, this mostly only applies if you're doing this as a hobby, and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay, you should probably worry a little more.

And on the other side of the spectrum, to those who think this video was faked: it wasn't lol. As mentioned before, I already knew how to make 2D games and how to program things, arguably the hardest part of developing games. Because of that, the focus of this video wasn't on that but rather applying what I knew to 3D games by learning 3D modelling, animation, and how to work with Unity, which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such. But mostly this was just for shits and giggles since I find messing around with 3D games entertaining, and I feel like people may be reading into it too much lol. Also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar, but that was caused by how I usually record clips while video editing, and not when I'm actually making the games. So I just have a weird workflow.

And last thing, to YouTube: why the fuck does this have 500,000 views. did the algorithm break? I can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500,000 views, and this is definitely not one of them. so if you're watching this, go watch someone else's video or something, this one has way too many views already.",0

"The first talk was great. Solo developers can get caught up following professional project management methods but forget the factor of individual motivation. E.g., it might be faster to first deal with the most complex problem, but making small wins working on art or marketing along the way helps you to stay motivated.",1
"Was amazing to be involved in this! Hopefully you all can get some good nuggets out of it, along with being more prepared for the hidden pitfalls!",1
The talks were good. But their personal reflections were amazing. We really put these guys on a pedestal but we tend to ignore the emotional impact of solo development. The gratification when the project is finished is amazing but the journey there definitely seems like a rollercoaster.,1
"Independent developers should bookmark this + ""Cursed Problems in Game Design"" also hosted by GDC. 
2 of the best imo",1
"I had my second project planned before releasing the first game, which helped me skip that depressing stage after releasing. There's really no happiness at the end of the road no matter how many sales you make, so gotta enjoy the adventure and hop on the next one right away.",1
Such a great and relevant session! Each of the panelists had a ton of valuable insights to offer. Thank you!,1
"I'm absolutely stunned how much emotional i got with this speeches. Kind of like in the last public question I'm also doing a board game and I'm happy to hear that games take extremely long to port and that it is a rollercoaster of emotions and full of pitfalls to watch out for. But as long as I keep looking back at my younger self who started my ""Streamers Ace Project"" I can't make him sad and quit. Thanks for that amazing talk and all your effort you all put into it.",1
I love how they all highlight different spectrum of solo development!,1
"I have to ask, how do you line up the monitor camera transitions so well XD? Is it really just holding the camera precariously at an angle that lines up the monitor bezels and then moving it out? So well done.",1
"As a dev, I liked that small insight into the code and class implementations! Would be up to see more of that in future.",1
"You motivated me to start being more orderly, to have plants and to eat healthier. I really like your routine and I'm trying to improve mine as well. Soon I will also enter patreot. I really appreciate what you are doing.",1
"I love these calm, relaxing devlogs! Keep it up! :DD",1
"I feel like enjoying your healthy daily routine, more than the coding part XD. I like how you mix designing, modeling, coding and life style content in your dev logs, great content !",1
Your videos are such a treat to watch. Always excited when a new one is posted. Keep up the good work! The game is really coming along nicely!,1
This game feels way better to me now that you've chilled out the tool usage. A really good and subtle change to the vibe.,1

"Save you 14 minutes:

Games as a service are vastly more profitable than the initial revenue from games.",1
"The reason triple AAA games are becoming so expensive and some are totally failing is just because they focus on tech and not on design. They're treating what were supposed to be  enjoyable games as engine demos and not giving enough time to release them properly. You can't just create another GTA V every single year, that shit takes A LOT of time.",0
"Another issue is that whenever you sink that much money into a single project, the designers have to give up a significant amount of creative control. Business just won't allow that much money to be spent on an experiment. Everything ends up being the old tried and true so you end up with very samey, uncreative, bland games that look really nice.",0
"When some people say ""games from older generations were better"" I must agree.. As a kid I imagined how insane the games would look like with so much more options to buy and play with even better graphics and physics. But sadly nowadays most titles are just cash grabs and the fun part is ignored, its hard to find triple A titles with good and fun gameplay without only pay2win features. Thats why I'm revisiting emulation, indie games and a few AAA titles which are worth the money and also the playtime.",1
I've been telling my friends this for the past couple years. We are going to see fewer AAA games because games not only have to compete with other new releases but all of the pre-existing games as well. There is just so much competition in this industry.,0
"It’s awful sad to see how stuff goes to thrash when the general public gets access. Look at YouTube itself, with its mandatory  “ad friendly content”, social media taking over everything, lack of variety due to companies milking “winning formulas” dry; Game companies noticing that the casual player is not demanding quality at all… it sucks.",0
I remember freshman year when you would be working on your games in class. Cool to see how far you’ve come with it.,1
I hope one day to be able to look back at your progress as greatly as you have been able! Super hyped for the release :),1

Dani is literally the reason I've started game dev. He might not realize this but he's inspired alot of people including me. And  karlson is literally my dream game...mainly because I grew up playing mirror's edge and other parkour games.,1
"underrated? I agree he’s extremely good at game development, but he also has millions of subscribers, millions more viewers, and two of his later games both got incredibly well received and took the front page of steam by storm. Not to mention Karlson is incredibly anticipated by millions, and one of the most wishlisted games on steam. Many other solo game-devs out there who pour just as much, if not more time and effort into making games just as good could not dream of that. Someone who likely everyone who clicked on this video already knows is not what i’d call underrated, there are plenty of smaller game devs who are overshadowed by the more well known ones like Dani. I’m not saying it’s his fault or anything, I watch him and support him, i’m just saying the claim that he’s underrated, let alone the most underrated, is incredibly wrong as far as i’m concerned.",1
"He ain’t overrated not underrated, he’s a extremely brilliant developer who is wellrated",1
"At first, I thought this was going to be a bad retelling of Danis history video but instead it talked about things after that and in-depth telling of crab game and muck that was pretty entertaining. Keep doing what you're doing in a few years you will with no doubt have 1 million if you keep it up.",1
"Good video, wouldn't agree with the title though since well he's one of the most popular indie devs out there with an audience of over 3 million on youtube and the 2 free games he put on steam being orders of magnitude bigger than even successful games. But hey titles are titles it didn't really get driven on particularly much in the video.",1
"such amazing content creator , definitely needs more support, you earned  a subscriber, hoping for more nice content",1
that desk would’ve taken me at least 3 days to draw,0
"This is one of my fav videos from you lately! I loved seeing more of your late development process. I’ll be building my gaming pc soon aswell, so I’m really hype for the launch of “Monster Tower” lmao",1
Nice video Reece! I'm always impressed by the cool and unique videos ideas you think of😁,1
"this game looks fkng great, i love those kinds of games like go and explore by yourself  no one will stop u and says hey go here and here",1
"Awesome way to beat Procrastination :D  I'm barely even keeping a 'To-Do' list with my current project (I have a list with 5 tasks - 3 are done lol) .. hopefully this will inspire me to be more organized because it will speed up my development 200%  
You've inspired me as always Reece! (And I've only been awake 15 mins :D)",1
"Hey Reece! This is a really cool and unique video idea and great execution :) Love the insights and entertainment I got here since I could also totally relate to all the time consuming tasks of game dev. Usually I calculate for everything 2-3x the time I write down because it usually takes longer and unexpected things start to happen, always!! :)",1
"That was anticlimactic😂
Love the video though! Great idea to challenge yourself and get yourself motivated again!",1
It's so hard not to crunch during game dev. Big ups  for this!,1
The game is looking great! Really interesting challenge too. Since you drew I suggest a rematch to find a true winner.,1
"I'm just finishing up a computer science degree, and I really want to get into video game development. I play indie games almost constantly, and I love the idea of making something of my own that I myself and other people can enjoy, but I keep holding myself back because I'm scared and don't know where to start. This video was definitely helpful and inspiring to me, and it makes me feel like I actually have a shot at gaining the skills I need and making something cool!",1
"Hi,

Great video really gave some helpful insights, I'm currently in university studying computer science as every single company in my city said its a requirement, but I'm also going to be working on  my own projects hopefully I can skip the stage of being employed and start my own company, we can dream haha, but yeah this has been helpful, the information was concise and well presented, good job and thank you",1
My dream since I was like 12 is to work for Rockstar I hope I get there one day!,1
"These videos are really helpful, I watch them with my friends on Voicely whenever we practice coding. We all agree that we learned more from YouTube videos than from school lol",1
"Bro I just learned that the college Im planning on attending next year also has Japanese courses, which I've wanted to do since middle school. Combining that with game development could lead me to working for a Japanese developer like FromSoftware!",1
Thanks to *Ricch dawg* for being there for me when I truly needed strong support. You made this degree happen for me. By arranging digit credit card info for me to be able to do the payment have been struggling for 💤,1
hi there. This was a great video that has told me exactly what i need to know. Could you recommend some groups/communities that accept someone with no experience at all. I have a physical version of my game and i know the rules inside and out. I have learnt how to draw digitally and am transferring the art into a format that can be used in the game i want to make and a community that is welcoming and that gives feedback/advie would be awesome.,1
Bruh i write how to make a game engine and get a fucking adventure video,0
unreal engine left the chat,0
Pretty brave of Unity to sponsor their #1 competitor. Great stuff!,1
just imagine how cool a game engine jam would be,1
Really like the editing! Can def tell a lot of effort was put in.,1
The simple idea of making a game engine from scratch is just too impressive for my tiny brain to comprehend.,1
"Yo this video is SO GOOD my guy. I love how you used after effects for the entire editing process, but for real, incredible work. Glad to have my face featured, also 😎",1
"You could give him a revolver, that shoots but in a limited range (similar to the sword's range) Cool video btw",1
I feel like the older model could still work fine if you made him look more closely to a blob around the face area and just had a bigger emphasis around the face,1
Can't wait to see how it turns out. Looks sick so far 👌 👏,1
"Look into how Nuclear Throne does attack animations
It simply teleports the sword from one side of the player to the other while creating a separate slash object which slowly dissipates
I’ve used this technique in my current roguelike and it works amazingly well",1
"I’ve always wanted to make a game, and I’ve come up with many ideas for it, but I’ve never been committed enough to actually learn game development. Glad to see you pulling through and learning it. Keep up the great work. Also what if for a 2 hit floating sword combo, you swing it overhead for the first hit, and for the second attack the sword flings out and spins in a circle.",1
"I always tend to make my main characters cute and small. It makes it easier for the players to get attached to them, so as far as audience feedback goes, at least one dude likes the new design.

As for animations with floating hands, most of my characters have floating hands like yours, but mainly use ranged weapons. Limited pixel count makes melee combat hard to pull off, so don't be too hard on yourself if you have a hard time making it. If you're not too attached to the melee combat, why not focus on ranged instead? Kinda like cuphead focuses on ranged and has melee on the side.",1
My name is Len. Thanks for building an island for me!,1
"The artwork looks absolutely fantastic! That is a huuuge selling point for a game like this. People that like really chill games will love that. If the dungeons are cool enough for players who like a good diablo grind, you'll have a game that appeals to a huge variety of players.",1
"Yoo thanks for this it teaches soo much im a noob and have a dream and idea of eventually creating my own game. If it takes me 10yrs and only my friends play it doesnt matter, i will do it.",1
"Hi Julian! I love your game so far and am obsessed with the art style of it all! I am from California with a Bachelors degree in English and wanted to see if you needed a writer to develop the world lore or whatever story/campaign/quests/dialogue you want to bring into Len's Island. I don't have a portfolio since I am just starting to reach out to developers for my first opportunity to write for someone but would love to connect to maybe write a test piece for you, and if you like it then we could look into working together. I will write anything and everything for your game free for a full year and will sign an NDA to protect your work. Either way, I wish you all the best and thank you for your time!


-Logan",1
Been following this project for ages and I'm always blown away by the attention to detail in the level design. Super excited to see where the game goes from here!,1
Seems like a pretty large scope to launch this December.,1
"The game is looking awesome.
When I first saw your videos about your student-project-game and your new project it motivated me to work harder and now I am in Game-Design school myself :).
Thank you a lot for the motivation.


However I think it might be good to add some impact to Trees and Rocks when hit, like a little shake. 

As of right now the only indication you hit the Rock/Tree is the pop-up text and that is not really satisfying. (Not that its bad the way it is right now, just as feedback.)",1
"iTS SO AESTHETIC, definitely my favourite aspect is the versatility one has when playing, if one didnt want to dungeon crawl they could create amazing buildings etc and vice versa",1
"Love the video Goodgis. Having used bfxr in the past I'm gonna check out LabChirp now XD

Here are a few I didn't see in the video but I think are worth a mention:
- GraphicsGale (pixel art)
- Krita (FOSS, raster art)
- Sunvox (Music tracker)
- Petaporon (Simple Piano Roll Sequencer)
- FamiStudio (Chiptune Music)
- FamiTracker (Chiptune Music tracker)
- Chiptone (Sound Effects)",1
The one thing I think you really missed here in the raster editing section is Krita which is especially useful for creating tiling textures as well as having a really powerful painting workflow.,1
"For 2d art i personally use krita. Its free and pretty neat, its good with animation too!",1
"Really well put together video, loved the editing as always and I feel that the topic you picked up on today, is one that not many people do touch upon, but is incredibly essential, I know, I've been developing games for over 3 years now, and over one year with Unity. 
Really important topic and you grabbed it and gave a *perfect* video as always!
Good Job!
PS. _Almost to 30k!!_",1
I would just like to say that Audio software wise you have saved me so much research. Thank you for making this video and keep up the great work!,1
"I know that you can't get into it in a short video, but the political philosophy behind FOSS is fascinating. In many ways, FOSS, or at least its driving philosophies, predate proprietary software!",1
"2:47 Actually, all unity tools are available in the free version, you only need to pay when you exceed 100,000 dollars per year, there are no limits",1
"I like A and C, B may be good for caves",1
"press M to merge two or more points in blender, its rly useful. 
Also, nice vid! :D",1
"This is awesome, I've been working on mine for nearly two years now. Its crazy difficult to keep motivated but i always found myself coming back to get work done. My game releases next month and I can't wait. You've been doing it longer though, I respect you for the sheer amount of motivation you've had to keep up, and for starting a project this big!",1
This game has come a very long way and is looking amazing! Good job so far! Me too is working on a 3d survival game and it is quite fun,1
"Those models look great i love the style, also a fan of the editing :)",1
This looks awesome man! I love your idea of being able to make your base mobile and fly. Your terrain designs and creatures are also very cool. Keep up the good work and thanks for the video!,1
"The progress is looking super awesome and impressive! Also spending 3 years behind a single project shows dedication. Really like the features that you showed here especially where the one where the base starts flying. For the enemies A, B and C I actually like all of them. You could use all three and give different functionality to them like one of them are predator and hunts the other two and the player.

@0:45 you could use blender's ""Merge By Distance"" to merge the vertex. I just enable this by default and give the lowest distance value and blender just merges vertex automatically if they are too close like in your one. Saves lot of time.

Keep it up! :)",1
the game looks great i love the models also the video editing skills are great :D i wish i could make even one 3d model lol x''; i subscribed!!,1
It's really bold of you to ditch the safety of your master's degree to pursue your indie dev career. Truly inspiring and thanks for sharing your stats. I hope more indie devs do their sales overview; it helps aspiring game devs like me to gauge what's realistic and what's not when it comes to running a one-man studio,1
"Dude, that's awesome. Also making a game every 3 months ain't so bad. You're officially in the business now. I can't wait to one day join the rest of you.",1
"+1 to engagement metrics.

Also, after a year of it being up it would be cool to do a follow up video to see the life span of the game!",1
I appreciate you explaining the logistics of game development. It simply is something done out of passion.,1
"I usually don't leave good comments, but you're a pretty funny guy, good personality, and it's a shame that somebody so smart made very little on a really cool game like that. I hope it becomes much more successful. Shout out to all the underdog nerds out there who don't get what they truly deserve.",1
"The video was engaging and entertaining. I think continuing this level of quality regardless of topic is probably gonna get your channel to some serious viewership in the future. You seriously deserve more subs than what you have.  

Just keep doing what you’re doing. Thanks for the video.",1
"Dude that's awesome! It's a lot of money, don't knock yourself down over it. It's nice seeing a small indie dev become successful.",1
"The amount of hardwork you put in your video I can't say , you are amazing",1
"I love how transparent and motivating you are, keep it up I'm supporting u  💪💪",1
SUBSCRIBE! 🍔 Also follow me on twitch :) https://www.twitch.tv/barji,1
"a couple suggestions that might be fun to see in game: ropes that you can swing on would be a welcome addition to diversify gameplay. i think a small fireball would be a cool rock skin to put in the game as well (you can recolor it 5 different times to milk it as much as possible). i'm very exited to see this games future, so good luck.",1
An idea for the rock skins: maybe you can make them the gemstones in the cave and make them unlockable by interacting with the gemstones down there? Sounds pretty neat,1
"2:18
To be honest man, this was actually pretty good! It has a nice friendly yet also slightly cursed (in a good way) feeling to it :)",1
Personally I think adding a way for the seekers to set bananas' as traps that would show the location of a hider that triggers it might be cool :),1
wonderful and fantastic tutorial! It's really helpful. The explanation is so clear. thumb up to the tutor.,1
"Loved the video..it's very informative and insightful under 8 mins..
Quiz Answers: 1st and 2nd are supervised while 3rd is unsupervised",1
"@Simplilearn  Thank you for this video! Shows the power of simplicity and your ability to simplify things. And asking people to comment on the 3 scenarios, great engagement strategy! 🙂",1
"wow! this is my first time actually researching this topic being a computer science student. i have got to say, this really brightened my mood and brought some light to my day/mind regarding my major! :) awesome stuff!",1
"I am from a health care background, but I could effortlessly understand everything she said. Excellent introduction.",1
Thank you for such great video. I hope my all concepts will be cleared through this sessions🙌,1
"Respected ma'am, the video was highly informative. Thank you ma'am for teaching so many concepts about machines😄😄",1
I had so much fun filming this video! I love the final product. Thank you Wired!,1
the little girl blew her cover so  early in her career,0
I like listening to smart people talking about stuff they know alot about,1
"Im acualy suprised how good an precise she explaind machine learning to the child....
Respect",1
"*This is not just a computer scientist, she is an amazing communicator. She mirrors the talking points of the learner, and always positively commends their opinions, all while constantly smiling and making the learner feel at ease. What an amazing person!*",1
Hilary is exceptional at explaining and engaging with people at all different levels of expertise.,1
"Hilary Mason is not only a computer scientist, but one of the first famous 'Data Scientists', a very well-known word today, but not so much a decade ago. Her research and knowledge sharing has helped to develop the field into becoming the vast and useful network it is today.

Great video!",1
2 semesters worth of classes in one vid. Thanks,1
This is a great tutorial that covers all areas of machine learning perfectly! Thanks to Edureka!! Can I please get the datasets and the codes used in the video?,1
"The best training I had seen till now on youtube, no adds, no waste of time, very detail!",1
Thanks a lot for this course. Can you explain the relation between Inferential statistics and neural network models?? both can be used for predicting outcomes. Please do explain me in detail.,1
Dear Edureka! This is one of the finest videos I have seen that has really helped me prepare well for my campus placement process,1
"Thank you so much Edureka!! Can the datasets and the codes used by the instructors be shared? Also, it would be great to have some sort of notes of the tutorial if those can be shared as well. Thanks again!",1
Really resourceful. This course helped get up to speed on the subject. Thank you Edureka,1
"I'm up to 5 hours into the video so far.. excellent teaching, looking forward to the last parts..thank you.",1
"I love how well you break this down into small, understandable bits.  Excellent work!!",1
Great job explaining the concepts. Simple and effective communication.,1
The explanation is fantastic! Thank you for your work!,1
"Nice explanation, for the first time in 5.22 minutes I have understand what is machine learning !! Thank you. Waiting for more tutorials videos.",1
These are awesome set of videos.  Really like the fact that they are well structured and concise.,1
"Excellent instructor, thank you so much!",1
"Four years later, and this is so instructional.
Thank you for the video.",1
"I'm just starting out and I liked this video. Interesting to learn about machine learning applications like image recognition, fraud detection and recommendation systems that we see on Google search and next video recommendations on YouTube. Also interesting to know about predictive models and that data is used to train the model to serve predictions which results in answering questions. Good one.",1
The explanation is fantastic! Thank you for your work!,1
I'm so happy that you started giving courses on machine learning. I appreciate your clear teaching style.,1
"Words are not enough to appreciate what you present in your channel, I do believe you are number one in programming.",1
"for info: 
1) At 32:52, to avoid UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, we need to train the model with the values of input_dataset. i.e, use X.values instead of X in model.fit(X.values, y). 
2) 42:04, joblib is now a seperate py package. we now need to import it as import joblib rather than from skilearn.externals. 
Anyway thanks Mosh for another great tutorial..",1
"Finally, I found something practical rather than theoretical.
Thank you sir😇",1
"Mister Mosh, thank you for all of the easy to follow tutorials that you make for us, please keep keep up the good work, i hope you post more courses (preferably in python)  :)",1
"I'm so glad I stumbled upon this. You are amazing! This was very pleasant and easy to follow. I learned a ton and I especially like that you took us through your thought process while examining the music data set, too. Thank you very much! Subscribed.",1
You are the reason why I started programming. I'll never forget the things you've done to help me.,1
Thank you so much! Very clear and neat explanation! I hope you will continue diving deeper into detailed concepts rather than concentrating only on basics. Your way of explanation plus the details would be the great video for all I think!,1
Amazing tutorial! You explained everything so clearly and helped me to grasp some of the topics even better!,1
"Hey Mosh, your contents and teaching style  are straightforward and easy to follow. It would be great help if you do some tutorials based on medical imaging (CT,MRI) data! I am having difficulties in dealing with those. Thank you!",1
"I like indices!!!

1:49 | Gathering Data
2:21 | Preparing Data
4:03 | Model Selection
4:30 | Training
6:46 | Evaluation
7:24 | Parameter Tuning
8:55 | Prediction",1
I'm amazed how a complex topic could be explained seamlessly!. Great video.,1
"Having just studied machine learning and coding for it, this is a great, simple and logical explanation in common conversation.  Well done!",1
Very informative video.  Thanks for explaining a fairly complicated subject in a simple explanation that makes sense,1
"I have watched many videos now, and this was the best for AI beginners IMO. Thank you!",1
It is great lecture and explains the topic very clearly and simply.i will follow all the videos because comparing to other programs and books this the most clear videos I’ve seen so far,1
"Thank you, I am new to the IT industry and I found your explanation very easy to digest especially from a lay person's pov",1
I love how he explained the steps of Machine Learning in simplified plain english. thank you very much!!,1
Very clearly explained! Thank you so much Mr. Guo!,1
"I love these videos. I just had a tech exec at a Fortune 200 company ask me for any podcasts that could help him stay abreast of current/emerging technology. I didn't have a great answer for him, but I did mention this series. He was looking for more audio-centric content though. Food for thought, @IBM Technology!",1
Fun-filled tech bites . Loved it,1
"I don't completely agree on deep learning explanation, because for weight training, labelling is required. Yes pattern/feature extraction can be debated, but labelled data is required",0
"Nice, loved it.",1

"Having done machine learning in the past year, this was actually a really good revision.",1
Perfect example of age doesn't matter if you have knowledge <3. Nicely done bro,1
This course is the BEST I’ve ever seen/heard explaining the concepts of Machine Learning/Deep Learning. Just simply awesome. MIT students are really lucky  to have this professor. Makes me wish to be a college student again :-),1
"Sir good evening , I am not related to this subject but your way of explaining subject matter is excellent .You are lecturer from top most institute in the world so I love to watch way of teaching process , methods and dealing with subject topics.your attitude and way of dealing contents is Very simple.Congratulations sir..",1
"I thank MIT for uploading such a valuable videos to the world.
Will definitely make a donation to MIT after I got my dream job.
I can listen to this teacher 100 hours continuously. the way he spread words and his character.",1
This is GOD level content. Wow! I want to salute this man for explaining complex ideas in such simple terms. No wonder MIT grads learn so well :( I can only wish.,1
I don't always like his sense of humor but this is an excellent lecture by professor Eric Grimson,1
"This is how you teach students! awesome explanations. without the explanation of the fundamental terminologies as he is doing here, machine learning becomes boring to learn",0
i think that eric is a tremendous teacher; really enjoy watching him explain stuff,1
What an amazing video. So easy to understand. Thank you so much!,1
I can listen to this teacher 100 hours continuously. the way he spread words and his character.,1
I thank MIT for uploading such a valuable videos to the world.,1
"Regards, awesome explanation.",1
"As a person who has self-learned a bit of python and is just trying to learn this stuff, this is exactly the best place to begin.",1
One “like” is not enough for the work that has gone into making one such video. This video should be part of the curriculum and he should get the royalty for this. Awesome work!,1
"This video kickstarted my journey in ML a year back. Trust me, back then I watched this video three times to finally understand. It might be challenging for few to get it but when you get it, it just feels amazing",1
"I'm in my first year of engineering, looking to go into CS, and this video makes me extremely excited for my coming education. I've already watched so many of your videos, and they've all had a similar effect. Thank you so much!",1
"I am just astounded. I spent so much time trying to understand this concept. Everywhere I looked people would show the similar neural network animation, but no one ever really explained and exemplified every single step, layer, term and mathematics behind it. 

The video is really well structured and with amazing animations. Extremely well done. My mind is so blown I can barely write this comment.",1
I am Programming for more than ten years and I never saw anyone explain a complex idea by such a clean and clear terms. Well done.,1
Thank you so much for the visualizations! I think if math teachers always refer to how it pictorially looks the intuition would be easier to get. This is why you and Dr. Strang from MIT have good content!,1
"Finally ML, thank you so much. I would be interested in a ""beyond 100sec"", or more short vids in this topic. Keep it up! 🔥",1
"You know, every time I want to learn some new framework or language, I come here for your 100 seconds series. Every. Time. You manage to explain what's important about a topic in barely 2 minutes, which drives people like me to *want* to learn more.

Love your vids, editing today was 🔥 as always!",1
"I still don't get how you can push out so much content with high quality so often/quickly!

Well done once again 👏",1
I love the little bits of humour that you inject into the images without acknowledging them in your audio. So good 😸,1
finally i can add machine learning specialist to my portfolio.,1
"Finally 
The best explanation of ML in 100 seconds has landed on earth

Definitely more machine learning content on this channel! I'd love to dive into it with your help!,1
I would love some more content on machine learning! Great video as always,1
"I love this content, and the concise nature in which its delivered!",1
"She is such a good teacher , never knew Machine leaening and AI could be this interesting.",1
"Carrie Ann, I want to thank you for bringing so much enthusiasm to the topic. This is exciting stuff, but it can be shown in a very static and boring way, and you don't do that.",1
I love how the code was placed right next to the decision tree! It was so simple to understand the tree and with the code right next to the branches I felt the same simplicity merge over as I looked at the code. Definitely a smart way to relieve the anxiety of trying to figure out a new code! Seeing this makes me think that if kids are exposed to math and science examples like this in programming courses or even in after school activities they'd be even more adaptable to learning how to code!  You guys are amazing! Please keep the videos coming!,1
"The most fascinating part about DeepMind's AlphaZero is that it did not need human-created training data. It only needed to play itself enough times, and by sheer volume, become a master. Humans can't do that, unfortunately.",1
"I would really love to see a crash course series on the practical skills that scientists need (IE latex, soldering, writing a research paper, advanced lab skills, etc.)",1
as someone aiming to double major in entomology and computer science this video is right up my alley! love the example chosen for this episode!,1
As a newcomer to Machine Learning this was a great overview. Thank you!,1
Spectacularly well done video on fairly complex topics! I'm new to machine learning in general and I want to learn more. I'll be watching your other videos on related topics next. Thank you!,1
"I'm taking a machine learning course and this is what I needed to completely understand each method. Great video, concise and easy to follow. Thanks!",1
"Amazing content, straight to the point whilst still being detailed",1
"Amazing content, straight to the point whilst still being detailed",1
I love how the explanation is made to everyone with experience or not in this issue. I’m in the second group and now I have a reference to start. Thank you ☺️,1
Great ! It gives an overview of the subject and acts as a roadmap to dive deeper into the study of ML,1
This is awesome.  Package your stuff into a Udemy teaching course that rewards you for all this shared knowledge and wisdom about ML!,1

"Woah, this video was epic! I think the work you're doing here is really important. 

I try to stop myself from slipping into the ol' Zarg langauge on the daily, glad to know I'm not alone in our fight! I think they have some sort of brain infiltration device or something.",1
"I'm so happy i found this video and your channel! This was so useful for me, I thought I was the only one who felt Andrew Ng was speaking Zarglar after the first couple of modules. You've inspired me to try again with the try-get stuck-research and repeat method. Thanks!",1
"Thank you. I think my education goes well with ML or AI. I got a degree in psychology (neurobiology focus), math and CS. Just started pursuing python once more to go into data science",1
"You did a great job introducing the ""how to learn"" aspect of what I think stumps a lot of intimidated curious learners. Basically, when you explained ""When I saw this I didn't know what it meant, so I googled it."" That is crazily enough, a big lesson to learn.  Just hearing that at least is encouraging me to take my first independent steps to learning this stuff.  So of course, thanks for the video!",1
"This may be the best YouTube tutorial ever. Making the process of learning this entertaining is fantastic. I had to go about it in the same way, and I *wish* there had been a video like this years ago... Sending this to my son. Thanks!",1
I had the same exact problem when I started learning: too much jargon and not enough explaining. The tutorial series by a channel called giant_neural_network was great because he teaches you not only the theory but also how to actually code a simple neural network. He does it very visually and it is very well done.,1
Very insightful! I learned a lot. Thank you.,1
"Now, that's interesting. I had been seeing DevOps all the time on this channel and now it's time to put ML, DL and DS stuffs.",1
Interesting and knowledgeable presentation.,1
Thanks for super simple explanation,1
Very nice overview thanks,1
Is there any tool/product in IBM which I can use to ingest various types of data who provides me built-in machine learning algo to predicts actionable insights based on pattern without spending anything for certain time or size of data? I really believe IBM is way advance in AI/ML than any other big players but its just how you market it.,1
"I guess you can't teach self-driving cars using RL in the real world (punishing them if they collide would be a little too late). So I would guess that RL is used only in lab simulations, and then later in the real world, these systems are only performing the task (without actively using RL). Do I get it right?",0
Nice summary,1
"It seems all the good teachers are left-handed, I hope I can be one too",1
Weldone Luv. Awesome presentation. 👏🏾💯,1
Seriously this plugin Kite is awesome and saves you a ton of time. Plus its FREE! Try it out: https://kite.com/download/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=techwithtim&utm_content=how-to-get-started-with-machine-learning,1
"Thank you for the recommendations, I’m really into AI programming and I want to leave my truck driver job to start as a programmer. I’ve working with that about five years ago. Even been 36 I am definitely going for it!",1
"This was awesome! As someone who is still only recently introduced into the CS field and interested in perhaps dabbling in ML/AI, this was really helpful for people like me. Thank you.",1
The most surprising thing for me is that I have always been interested in AI but did not know what computer science classes to take to follow this through. I ended up taking a fundamentals to data science class this semsester and it taught me much of the Basic AI algorithms that you mentioned.  I guess luck is on my side lol,1
"Also it may be wise to learn MATLAB to a fairly advanced level before doing ML. The jump from basic Python to ML is quite a big one,  I was not able to make that jump and got fired from my job because of it. You must know how to populate matrices by row and column, take the average, etc. A basic Python course won't cover these things, but MATLAB courses are more specific for the type of things you will be doing as an machine learning engineer or data scientist.",0
"Hey Tim, good video! One thing I would say is that I wouldn't recommend beginners to start with Reinforcement Learning - as a matter of fact I think that's one of the more advanced applications. Supervised Learning with Neural Nets or Computer Vision would be my suggestions before going to Reinforcement.",1
You’re an amazing speaker and explain concepts very well. Thanks for your invaluable videos. :),1
"Really liked the step-by-step breakdown of the process, the whole video was very informative !",1
"Laurence, thank you so much for taking the time to put out such concise, intuitive walkthroughs. You manage to make everything going on behind the curtain really accessible and unintimidating!",1
Nice explanation. I am also building a course on ML in Python (for a University) more from an implementation perspective. This surely helps!,1
"I love these tutorials and videos that Tensorflow puts out. Super informative. Thank you Laurence, what a great video! You bet I'll keep watching these series! Have a fantastic day everyone!😁👍",1
Subscribed after watching this. Love the way you explain. You explain the concept very clearly and also you add a little bit of the code which gives me a great preparation for the coding application. Keep up the good work Lawrence,1
Hey there Lawrence. Really good explanation. Thanks for putting together. Just wanted to ask how often these vids will come out?,1
Thank You for explaining this so clearly and eloquently.,1
"Great explanation, I loved the way you explained it! I'm excited to see more!",1
Was just waiting for this from  Lawrence. I m learning machine learning daily and time to take this to next level. Thanks Lawrence and Google and tensor flow,1
"Extremely helpful explanation, thank you very much!",1
"this video is soo good❣️
I watched this many times to understand what ML is.
I studied Matlab at University, this video is also good for review of ML😊",1
"I have launched my own start up! In celebration of that we are giving away $10,000 in crypto! Make sure to enter the METACENT $10,000 GIVEAWAY:

"You should learn machine learning even if you don't intend to be a machine learning engineer.   ML is a tool, an important one that can help make sense from data.   In the future,  knowing how to use ML as a tool will be equivalent to knowing how to use Excel today.   It doesn't mean that everyone needs to know how to build a spreadsheet application but one would be highly handicapped if he or she doesn't know how to use one.",1
"Well, as someone who likes research in AI, I give major credit to Software Engineer. The math is pretty intense to always remember so Software Engineers are very good at making black boxes that are reusable. So I think everyone in technology is just as important.",1
"I absolutely agree with you. From my experience toward my research, machine learning is only useful if there is data available to extract features. However, if you are extracting features from unknown observation then model-based approach is very useful. These days a hybrid between model-based approach and machine learning techniques are useful",1
Great video Smitha. I have been working as a developer for about a year now and I just landed a job as a data scientist. I’m hoping to transition into ML in a few years!,1
"Thank you for the honest talk. The more I learn about machine learning, the more I realize that what you say is true. At the same time, everyone is different. Some people will simply do anything to work in ML and that's okay.",1
i took an introductory crash course and some of the simple projects that we did were so cool that i want to learn more about ML and make more exciting projects. thanks for guidance :),1
"Thank you for the info.
However I think this advice applies to just about every career. 
Especially in the fast changing world we are in even accounting has to be looked at.",1
"Wow, massive learnings, thanks! I wonder if you wouldn’t mind discussing the kind of limitations a hobbyist would face? What kind of projects are possible?",1
"I have been studying Deep Learning for the last 3 weeks or so and this guy explained it like in 20 minutes, I wish I had a teacher like him :(",1
"There should be a button of ""Mega Like"" for this video. Great explanation of an epic tool. Thanks a lot!",1
"The best explanation of convolution in few minutes.
🙏",1
This is an amazing smooth intro to a relatively complicated topic. The QR codes are a smart move. Hoping to see more videos on similar topics. Thank you both.,1
"Wow I've been reading about this stuff a lot but always had difficulty wrapping my head around it.  I did the tensorflow demos, but was unable to understand it well enough to try something on my own.  He explained it very clearly and cleaned up a lot of my misunderstanding.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!",1
I can't even tell you how much more I enjoy using TensorFlow 2.0 than I did using the previous versions. Thank you for all the great improvements. A special thank you for TensorBoard. A very useful and fun tool.,1
"Laurence's explanations were wonderful! Thorough, but also simple enough that even a newbie can understand it. Thank you!",1
"Wow .. this was an awesome presentation, I'll focus on the first speaker since I was somewhat familiar with the subject (I also liked the second one). 

He explained all of the key concepts as clearly as I have seen - and I have looked at a LOT of videos, this is a master class in how to do it. I hope he presents on many more related topics. Definitely worth watching.


Thank you so much!",1
"Amazing video, there's many elements here that are explained so well. Looking forward to doing more stuff with TF in the future! :)",1
"I wish i had watched this a year ago. Easy to understand with great details! Thank you, sir!",1
This is the best quick explanation of machine learning I have seen to date. You covered the first few weeks of the course extremely well and concisely. I shared with all my friends to get them more hyped about machine learning!,1
"With gradient descent, we generally don't  update one parameter and 'then' another. Rather, parameter updates are done simultaneously. Great video overall. I like how you started with a simple model structure and skipped the derivations to keep things understandable to a broader audience.",1
"Hey it would be great if u could do a  machine learning course for complete beginners, here on YouTube. I really enjoyed this vedio! Thanks you so much for this!!",1
Nice video! Hands down your channel has delivered the most useful information to me and my future. Not to mention interesting videos like this one. I've been doing discrete math stuff and so it's refreshing to learn about more continuous and applied math concepts.,1
"This is a great explanation of a very complex subject. While incorporating and utilizing such a topic doesn't require an intense understanding of the process, it does help to share the facts with others.",1
"Thank you for your video. I was wondering if you've done an electrical engineering degree would you have enough of the relevant math covered to go into machine learning/ artificial intelligence or would you need to take some extra classes? 

I'm guessing statistics would be needed, but what about everything else?

Thank you again. Keep up the good work",1
"I already took the Coursera course, but BOI was this a good refresher. Also helps me as a CS major have a clearer idea of what math I'll need to take. Thanks again!",1
You did a phenomenal job explaining this. Thanks a lot!,1
"Hey there! Happy New Year! Speaking of the new year, you might be wondering ""is this still valid for 2021?"" and the answer is yes, it's still valid for 2021.

However, you might notice a few changes to the websites mentioned throughout video (some have had a design change), including sites like Made with ML who've recently pivoted: https://madewithml.com/pivot/

All of the main concepts remain valid for the new year.

If anything changes drastically, I'll look to update/make a new version of this video.

In the meantime, happy machine learning!",1
"Daniel you, my friend, are a legend. It's so good to see such passion and enthusiasm for your craft, and the ML community is glad to have someone like you blazing a trail so that the new members can follow.",1
Presentations in the technical field such as this rarely have this much quality knowledge packed into them but it's even rarer that they are this aesthetically pleasing!,1
"Daniel, thanks for this superb video. As someone just starting out on this road, it's very easy to get sucked into the fine details, but this has given me a much better grasp of the big picture. I love your philosophy of not learning for learning's sake, but using this knowledge to build things that matter to people. Keep doing what you're doing!",1
"Hello Daniel, Just wanted to say thank you for sharing your knowledge and resources. I have been following you for weeks now and your channel is my favorite to learn about machine Learning... very inspiring and insightful ! Thank you and keep up the good work mate! 
Cheers, Aymane",1
"WOW!!!! Thank you for the incredible amount of work you put into this project, it is truly an amazing creation!! Very useful and relative information and the interactive map is really cool! Stupendous!",1

"I've never left a comment on YouTube, but I feel like I MUST DO after watching this video. It is very organized and useful to understand how we approach ML and keep learning it. I appreciate you made this great one.",1
"This is gold., Thanks mate, just about to begin my journey of learning Data Science and Machine Learning and this has definitely helped me to orient myself within the field. All the best.",1
"Daniel, this is an amazing video. I came back to say thank you for putting extensive work to make this video. The map, instructions, and resources are super helpful. This is the best guidance I have seen so far!

Thank You Daniel",1
First lecture in the 2019 deep learning series! It's humbling to have the opportunity to teach at MIT and exciting to be part of the AI community. Thank you all for the support and great discussions over the past few years. It's been an amazing ride.,1
I really admire the work that Lex is doing both at MIT and his podcast!,1
"Thanks, professor.
It's noticeable that you put on the effort to put things in context.
Very good.",1
"Thank you so much Lex. This will help us a lot. This will help the students, who cant afford paid online courses and none in the neighbourhood can teach.",1
"This lecture is awesome and really inspiring. I've been a fan now for years now Lex, and I'm really happy to see your success. I just wanted to point out that I believe your analysis of ""One Shot Learning"" re: human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base. The learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling, sitting up, and standing up. This process takes usually between 1 and 2 years. This time (and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it) is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible. The process can be accelerated through coordination-specific training on the part of the parents (which occurs quite often). Errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road (e.g. requiring knee replacement at 55) Bipedalism is pretty complex, and is way harder than quadrupedalism, which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim.",1
"A great introduction lecture! Full of “fruit”, I learned a lot in just a hour. Thanks a lot for sharing!",1
"This is great amazing lecture! one question though about the baby walking: isn't it very hard to quantify the data points (synaptic firing) a babies brain accesses when learning to walk? - if we don't fully understand the brain and neurological connection, how do we quantify and compare the training data between the human brain and AI?",1
"Thank you so much, Mr. Lex Fridman, for contribution and sharing your lectures!",1
Lex is a really admirable professor applying academy to solve real world problems through engineering ways. Kudos!,1
Absolutely amazing! I love how you explained this!,1
"I started studying computer science 2015. I really never knew much about computer science. I started in the first semester with a programming course and came across this video and I was fascinated by this! Now in the last semester, I am writing my bachelorthesis in neural networks!

You were my inspiration!",1
"Revisiting this video today. This the video that got me into AI. I'm a Deep Learning Engineer today. Thanks, SethBling. Cheers!",1
This video was my first exposure to neural networks when I was in high school. Now I’m a machine learning engineer at Google.,1
"A year ago I used this video to explain to my class what artificial intelligence was (or something like that, I don't remember) since I live in Mexico I had to translate and explain everything. Thanks for the video :) I learned, my classmates were entertained and I gave my teacher a good impression",1
"SethBling will make a sentient being using Mario World code injection lol, this whole stuff is super amazing, love it :D",1
"Few year back i watched this video as a newbie student and it give me a motivation to pursue AI as my career. Now, I'm writing my Master thesis and will soon join a company as Machine Learning Engineer. Revising this video feels so nostalgic. Thanks SethBling. Kudos :D",1
That is downright fascinating. Makes me wish I went into programming.,1
"this is undoubtedly one of the best, precise and to the point  tutorial videos on any learning site! I've tried many videos, but this has by far taught me the most! thanks so much!",1
Thank you sir for providing such a comprehensive knowledge on ML algorithms. I would like to share that the portion covered in this video is what is asked in most of the data analysis ML interviews. this basics are the building blocks to grow upon.,1
"Very nice! I'm taking a Machine Learning class on Coursrea and after watching this, I understand more of how to implement the algorithms. The class actually got me confused on how to apply it to daily tasks/projects. Now I have some projects in mind. :D",1
"As always, great quality lectures by SimpliLearn. Thank you!",1
Hello Sir! Thank you for this great tutorial! Can you send me the datasets for more practice please? Thank you in advance!,1
"Thank you so much for this wonderful online turtorial, I am a beginner to ML and this tutorial are so helpful. May I ask where can I get the data that has been used in this video for practice? Thank UUUU!",1
Thank you sir.Your team is doing so good for the purpose of  helping students.love & respect for simple learning team,1
Very well explained . Very good video for beginners. I highly recommend . Thank you so much for explaining in detail. The pace is absolutely perfect.,1
This is really a good video for starters in machine learning. Thank You for it. It would be really helpful if you could share the datasets used in the examples for self-practice. I don't prefer to share my email ID here in public chat. Please advise on alternatives to share my email ID for datasets. Thank You.,1
"Started this video casually. And got stuck to it for 2+ hours. Eventually gonna finish the whole. 
Important course, great information, smoothly explained. 
Raghu Raman👍",1
"This is awesome. There's absolutely no way I'm going to watch this right now, but it's great to see this quantity and quality of information posted for public benefit. I'm subscribing and sharing.",1
"Hi Op, my question is regarding the challenge of dealing with datasets in my project . The feature set contains about 40 columns from merging10 csv files to train my model. But the test dataset contains just 2 columns including the target column. So each time I try to make classification on the target column I get a failure notice telling me that my training and test shape are not the same. 


How can I make my model to make prediction based on the test dataset given to me? Or how can I adapt my test dataset to conform to the training dataset in shape in order to run my program?",0
"That's a fantastic video, i don't watched full but the way he taught is absolutely amazing. It will very beneficial if the videos are of 1 hour length and divided in playlist so that if a person don't have enough data balance can download one chunk at a time. It is very difficult to watch the video of this length at a time.",1
"Thank you so much for the informative lectures, better than many college level courses. But how can we get an access to the notebooks?",1
"Loved your content very much & learned by practicing with automotive related data being a Mechanical engineer. Lot of hurdles faced though but that is how you learn I say. Would appreciate a complete lecture of this particular session where entire ML is taught, checked your playlist of ML are those continuation of these classes, would appreciate your quick response. 
How can I utilize ML in manufacturing, Auto sector in India, since want to be in core also work on technological advancement using software since I like both the streams.
Lot of questions though, would like to get response.",1
Thanks Mr RaghuRaman. You really covered the Basics as they should be. This is the way to cover the PG course on Python. Thanks a lot.,1
I'm amazed by seeing your understanding with every algorithm👏👏. one day I'll also be able to do the same.,1
Thank you for this wonderful session. Can we have slides of this session?,1
Sir I just want to say Thank you to help us gain this knowledge and encourage us to start our data science journey,1
"Clear information, clarify every important point cover all topics. Thanks krish I participated you live session also... 👍",1
"Excellent session...everything about ML is summarised in a single video, which provides the complete picture of the elephant!",1
Your explanation is really good and content wise excellent sir. Thanks for sharing your videos and roadmaps and End2end explanation interview point of view .,1
Perfect binge watch for interview preparation. Thanks for uploading this Krish.,1
Thank you for putting everything together ☺️,1
"I am 41, I wish I had had the education those kids were getting.  The string activity was awesome to understand how connected we are",1
Insightful film ! Also loved how all the characters were brought together at the end !,1
If you really dig in deeper to find A.I's and machine learning reaching capabilities then they're really greater than us but always in specific sense. They doesn't posses capability to be more general like human but they outperform humans by incredible power in given specific tasks.,1
It is not a question if AI is good or bad. It is a question of using it in a good or bad way. Another thing is many people resist change of any type. Resisting change means that those people will be totally unable to cope when the change becomes everywhere.,0
"If the old guy is my grandfather, I think we would be talking about technologies all day long. Nice video!",1
Love it! That's why I teach kids between 9 and 12 how to code... Educating the next generation,1
"Technology looks beautiful in a documentary, when you try to learn it's a job",1
"With great power comes great responsibility... Great documentary, but I'm afraid this super-powerful technology will be used for evil purposes as well, as always in human history.",0
I'm just getting started with Machine Learning and this is a very helpful and motivating video. Thanks xx,1
"Hey Smitha, Thanks a lot for this great piece of advice.I am currently an data analytics intern at ey. i hope you make more videos on this and other useful resources.",1
Thank you Smitha. I have been pondering over ML not knowing from where to start. You have provided a good starting point. i really appreciate it,1
"This is a great video. Something I enjoyed was the background. Not too much to get distracted by, and you had a good presentation :)",1
"Hello. I am not (yet) an ML enthusiast, but clicked on the video because of the slight curiosity I have about it. But the ""no-zero days"" mention makes sense, & is a good reminder that such consistency is important for achieving one's goals.",1
"Thankyou for this video, This is really so amazing. I just didn't even think that way to look at what companies want from us but either way I am going to learn it for just fun😂😂  but maybe later on I would like to switch my carrier in it. Thankyou ❤",1
I have just started to look into ML and learn more about it and this video is an absolute motivator! Thanks! Subscribed!,1
I think Math is important because if you are trying to solve a problem with mL you need to at least or have an idea of what each mathematical concept/formula are going to solve and perfect for your problem.,1
"Hi all, thanks for watching! Hope this course has given you a solid foundation in the world of Computer Vision :)

"I watched a lots of deep learning tuturials before this, some of them were even twice as long as this and yet this explained the best and the most. Thank you for the awesome tutorial without ads for free. You are a hero.",1
This was such a great refresher course. Everything I needed to recollect and on point. Great job and thank you!,1
This is honest to god a great lecture and perfect for introducing deep learning! I hope there’s another video in the future that shows some light programming.,1
It was a good introductory course! Although there's lack of examples in the explanation of neural network part. But overall you can get the idea of how deep learning works.,1
"This was such a great refresher course. Everything I needed to recollect and on point. Great job and thank you!

"Excellent introduction to the topic. Great slides, great explanation, right pace. Really good.",1
"Awesome video, Jason. You've helped make this information accessible to thousands of new people.",1
Short and crisp overview of deep learning with cool intuitions. This is the only video that I will recommend to anyone who wants to start with deep learning and even machine learning in general.,1
Great video! I like the structure and the depth of knowledge shown in it.,1
This would be substantially more terrifying if the bots weren't drawn to be so cute...,0
"The true existential crisis comes when you realise he just described evolution in general.
We can recreate it, we benefit from it yet we have no clue why or how it's actually working beyond luck",0
"When Grey was talking about the warehouses and slaughterhouses, all I could do was think of Star Wars: the bots are basically equivalent to clones on Kamino. I would say the bots are less sentient, but the way Grey has depicted them makes that less certain and the comparison all the stronger.",0
"The topology of the learning network is based on that of the ""Perceptron"" built in the '50s with relays. In the end, the network conduct a converging weighting of probabilities to identify the correct event. Yes, even a picture is considered an event, a static one though. A dinamic event is defined by using vector spaces.
Thank you for the nice video!",1
"This is absolutely insane, I love this video and the way it explains everything (though I guess that isn't specific to this video)",1
"""Teacher bot can't teach, But it can test"" Did you just explain the entire American School system?",0
"checking in again after a google engineer claimed their LaMDA AI was sentient

this isn't the type of machine learning that AI uses, but still fascinating",1
"This was so helpful, I'm currently trying to teach my Pit Amiibo how to fight properly and this is going to help me big time in training it.",1
You’re such a great teacher!! All the bots look sooo cute as well and comprehensible graphics like always :D,1
"At times I feel so lucky being born in this age of internet, Otherwise it was no way possible for me to learn from this legend of machine learning for free, looking at this career  across academia and industry , he is a pioneer . It like learning integral calculus from Newton himself.",1
I just love how humble and friendly this prof is. Big fan,1
I am a 12th-grade student and really interested in machine learning. I did some basic math which is required in machine learning and am starting with this course today. I really liked the fact that the language which is used in this course is python. so excited to learn about this new branch. Will try my best to complete it. THANK YOU STANFORD FOR UPLOADING THESE LECTURES.,1
Andrew Ng is a legend. I took his course on Coursera and I wish the course never ended. I have taking a lot of Machine learning courses but none of them compare to Andrew's. He made complex concepts look trivial and established a theoretical background ('Intuition' as he would say).,1
"the way this man teaches is something which doesn't get you tired. you will watch him teach with a beaming smile on your face.
thanks for this great class.",1
Thank you for the course. It's very helpful for me ❤,1
In today's time Andrew Ng is legend by his ML knowledge 🤓,1
Very nice lecture,1
"This is so great for making these valuable ressources completely free to us. 

Would you consider uploading courses for civil engineering department?
Thank you 🙏🏽",1
"So nice lectures and professors .
Wish to attend a real lecture at MIT .",1
"Excellent for a newbie. Thanks for the great effort to cover all the basis in simple, but still reasonably indepth way.",1
"This is a great video for overview of AI and ML !
Will stay tuned for upcoming videos in this course.
Thanks MIT OCW.",1
Wow so glad y'all posted this! Exactly the field I'm trying to learn,1
"Thanks a lot for describing such a big comprehensive AI information in such a way that I can easily see and understand the forest of AI, especially machine learning !!!",1
"This is so exceptional  and simplified, am so grateful for this.",1
it's not always that you want an unlimited dataset in machine learning. Sometimes you want to limit your dataset. For example if you're trying to figure out if you're in a stock market recession or expansion you don't want to go over 2 years (+- months) of data because you'll end up in another cycle. Symmetry and Domain limits are important in machine learning. My point is sometimes too much data is a waste of time and resources,0
"thanks a lot MIT. If it is possible,could you make the videos of 18.04 Complex Variable with applications?I really want to watch that course.Thank you very much.😁",1
LOL  What a way to present dry material with a dry approach yet making it interesting and easy to follow  :-)  Great job!,1
Better than lots of courses on Udemy. I really like your humor,1
Wow this was so straight to the point with great visuals that I managed to figure out all in one go! Great stuff!,1
"you just did it in a perfect way. I've read blogs, ""best ML books"", and other resources, but you just nailed this. thank you!",1
I wish professors taught like this!! Such clarity - I am so thankful to you.,1
This guy has united his two passions—Machine Learning and guitar.,1
So much of quality content on Machine Learning!! I wish I knew about this channel a bit before. A must follow channel for ML & DS enthusiasts. Great job Josh :) Please continue the good work and serve the humanity!!,1
"Smitha, I loved the layout of the video and appreciate the emphasis on book learning. I am switching careers and want to emphasize ML and will follow the roadmap and let you know my thoughts.  Much respect.",1
"Hey Smitha thank you for the road map & humbly appreciate the time you put in making these videos for us all. If I may ask, there is another book that I have heard is great regarding machine learning titled "" Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by O'Reilly "" .... please do advise on what you think about this one.",1
"just loved your content, love the effort you put in every single video like its just WOW!! Keep creating the good content,
~Love",1
Thank you for an insightful video! 🙏 I am currently leading a team of data analysts and planning to get started on some ML projects in the team. Do you have any input on how a team manager can prepare to lead a team of ML engineers? Any pointers will be great. Thank you!,1
"Wow, congratulations for starting such an amazing project 👍",1
Wow Smitha you did amazing job feel proud of you.,1
"I am just getting started on Machine Learning, and this roadmap is a much-needed one. Thanks for creating this, much appreciated.",1
Loved your recommendations! I didn’t knew the deep dive book. Looks amazing. Thanks.,1
"I love this content and vibe of the channel. 
Thank you <3",1
"Part 3 will be on backpropagation.  I had originally planned to include it here, but the more I wanted to dig into a proper walk-through for what it's really doing, the more deserving it became of its own video.  Stay tuned!",1
"I'm only 12 minutes into this video right now, but I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the time and spacing you give to explaining a concept. You add pauses, you repeat things with slightly different wording, and you give examples and zoom in and out, linking to relevant thought processes that might help trigger an ""a-ha"" moment in the viewer. Many of these ""hooks"" actually make me understand concepts I've had trouble grasping in Maths, all because of your videos and the way you choose to explain things. So thanks! You're helping me a lot to become a smarter person. :)",1
Dissapointed you did not animate a 13000-dimensional graph. Would make things easier,0
"I'm an IT student, and we have an Assignment on exactly this topic. We even have to use the MNIST data set. I have to say, this is absolutely lifesaving and I can not thank you enough Grant. What you do here is something that only a handful of people on this planet can do, explain and visualize rather complicated topics beautifully and simple. So from me and A LOT of students all around the globe, thank you so so much <3.",1
"Unlike most  teachers of subjects like this, this gentleman seems to be genuinely concerned that his audience understands him, and he makes a concerted and highly successful effort to convey the ideas in a cogent, digestible and stimulating form.",1
"You sir deserve a noble, or an oscar...what an incredibly effective method of teaching. thank you so very much!!!

NO! BAD COMPUTER! made me crack up! lol",1
One of youtube's highest quality content channels! Chapeau,1
I just sat through a 3 day ML accelerator class and you series did a far better job at explaining them with 4 twenty minute videos. Well done mate. Really appreciate it. Thank you,1
"Hands down, I have never seen anyone explain mathematics so beautifully the way he does. Kudos!",1
"Thank you 3Blue1Brown for these videos, they're extremely instructive!
However there's one point that I didn't understand, why does the gradient descent algorithm struggle to find local minimas with swapped labels? If anyone could answer my question I'd be very grateful. 
Thank you.",1
"I feel this is one of the best courses I've ever seen on Machine learning. I was looking for something like this for months now. To my surprise, this course just released conveniently just before my spring break <3 
Thank you guys.",1
Thanks for your knowledge sharing sir. Required reinforcement learning. I hv subscribed just now.,1
"Thank you very much for the great effort
I want a video about a project ML Complete to understand how it works in real life",1
Thank you for putting out this course,1
This is great. please make advance course of ML and make some good projects like spam etc.,1
Thanks for doing this...,1
best channel I have ever seen.,1
"Thank You, instructor, for this awesome video. You explained very thing in quite simple and easily understandable manner",1
OMG!! Such awesome day to day life examples given for perfect understanding.. completely mesmerized 😊🙏,1
This is really helpful for preparing and facing the job interviews. Thank you for the video.,1
Very helpful and interesting video and covers almost all the areas with clear explanations. Thank you so much for the efforts,1
thanks a lot for all the efforts!! nice explanation and good content for the realtime based questions,1
Thanks for this Video. Very neatly calmly Explained the major ML terms.,1
Thanks for this Video. Very neatly calmly Explained the major ML terms.,1
Much gratitude for this informative lecture,1
"But this series is great, you can repost it in the next time. If possible, please add subtitles to the video!",1
"Steve is a phenomenal lecturer, isn't he?",1
"Just wanted to comment about how much I love these videos. Last year while applying for PhDs I was searching for passions. In a discussion with my friend (a computer scientist), I accidentally outlined genetic programming without knowing it. My friend told me so and I went researching. Found these videos and became enthralled. Now I have a PhD studentship in soft robotics and plan to use SINDy to help with modelling and control and honestly think that giving machines brains may be my future work too. Thanks Brunton, my passion was helped by your own.",1
Would love for a full series on how can we use RL to control real world dynamical systems!,1
Viewing reinforcement learning as time delayed supervised learning is a really good way of looking at it.,1
I just cannot express how grateful I am to prof Steve Brunton for posting these videos. Waking up at 6am to watch him explain is the most satisfying thing ever. Thank you! We all are grateful.,1
Great channel! Please record more videos on the edge of reinforcement learning and control theory. Congrats on your work.,1
"This sweet spot between control theory and machine learning definitely interests me, especially applied to astrodynamical systems. Please, continue making these videos, Professor Brunton!",1
"I’ve been following your content for a at least 4 years now! It’s the reason I am a robotics control engineer now, you pulled me through 4th year control systems with your conveniently-timed boot camp.   Please keep up the great content! 

PS are you accepting PhD students?",1
"Great video! If everyone was as great on YouTube as your delivery we would have a lot more passion in the area. Keep up the good work, train on!",1
"Thank you so much for this lecture. I really enjoy your videos, this is helpful as a PhD student. I also bought your book ""Data-driven science and engineering"" which have nice explanations for the tools I use. Keep on this awesome work! Greetings from France!",1
"Order: BADC
Working of a neural network:
- The weighted sum of the input is calculated
- The bias is added
- The result is fet to an activation function
- Specific neuron is activated

Nice video! It helped me to learn deep learning in 5 minutes",1
"Thank you so much for your presentation. I have learned a lot.

Exercise
Test size=0.2, C=1, kernel='poly
Accuracy: 99.17%",1
"hello great videos, loved this series.  Can you please do a video on imbalanced data sets in classifications problems?  Maybe just add onto a previous example you have but with a case where there are very few ""1"" or ""true"" values compared to ""0"" or ""false"" . thanks for you consideration!",1
Got 1.0 score when C=4 for iris data set. Thank you Sir! Your machine learning Playlist is a boon for beginners like me.,1
"Hello sir, thank you for your videos. It really helps from the beginner of the video which you have listed in data science playlist. 😄 
The model in default method is 99.65% in train and 99.4% in test. Whereas gamma method will lower down the accuracy of the model from 99.4% to 75% therefore it has explicit shows the gamma method is unsuitable for the scenario however the regularisation has improve the train set to 1 and testing set is retained the best accuracy of model. 
Yet, kernel parameter as linear has also provided a good accuracy of model.
Thank you for your guidance.",1
"Thank you very much for these videos. They are really helpful. I did the exercise and got 99% when C=4. Any increase in C did not affect the accuracy. Also, any alteration made to gamma and kernel dropped the accuracy drastically. Thank you once again.",1
"Great! Sir, Can you  elaborate something about plotting the hyperplane (the decision function) in matplotlib
I want to see the best line which classifies the data",1
"@codebasics, sir could you please make a video with regression models like KNN regression or random forest with train_test_validation set? Thank you for your amazing videos..I started my machine learning implementation journey with your tutorials.❤",1
What a wonderfull tutorial!! well done and well explained. Thanks a lot dude for the sharing of this expensive knowledge.,1
Hope you all enjoy this video; go subscribe to Ryan's channel for more machine-learning content! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Wq2V9Ws4vCUeGb-OlA9YA,1
"Just about to finish my first year studying statistics. A short course was about machine learning so I have some knowledge and understanding of machine learning so this was a very interesting video. We got to use and tweak different types of predictor models. We split the available data into training and test data and then used the training data, which included the outcome variable, to build the models and the test data, which didn't include the outcome variable, to test the models and later compare their results to the true outcome variable",1
"Good interview! But as someone who has already know the concept of data science and machine learning, I'm actually interested to know what are the differences between a data scientist and a ML engineer. Hope this question will be answered in a future video :)",1
Thank you Clement. We need more interviews with ML engineers in your channel.,1
I really hope Ryan starts a machine learning podcast or something. Its something I can pay for.,1
Great interview..learnt lot of things..I have a question..is DSA so important to become a data scientist?,1
Thank you simplylearn for explaining Machine learning in the most precise and ambient manner. I have been wanting to learn machine learning since a long back and today i scouted for your video. this seriously helped me learn The basics of machine Learning. Once again Thank you so much,1
"I must thank SL team for the video
. Absolute helpful for a layaman to understand. I have queries regarding the course. let me know how shall I contact",1
"Thank you so much! This was very informative, and very well explained. :)",1
"Thanks one more time for the richful tutorial and the explanations provided. 

I did the exercise consisting to predict the prices of the house from th 'boston housing' dataset. It works as explained in the video. I just have few questions concerning the training, test and prediction. Indeed, what guide the  right choice of the train/test_size and random_state values? In my code I changed the test_size value to 0.5 and the random_state to 7, I got a nice prediction for arrays [3] & [5] but not for array[9] for example! And when I compute the mean squared value, I get 33.36. Can such a value be acceptable? Thank you again for all.",1
"Absolutely awesome ,
Thanks for the video , would be great to see next implementation of any ML algorithm .",1
"Wow, I was wanting this type of video only, in which I could revise all the basics of Machine Learning! 
Thank you so much for uploading this",1
Nice tutorial.. Kindly upload more related to implementation demo of supervised and unsupervised learning.,1
"Hey, this video really made me catch my understanding of what is machine learning is... I referred to ton's of different video's I am able to understand kind of, but not meaningfully,  but this video gave me the complete meaning of machine learning to understand deep practically.",1
"Great video thank you ! One question : In the Mail filtering first example of the Naive Bayes theorem, what event does A refers to ? Thanks.",1
"Hello, how are you? 
From my point of view the video is very good and quite didactic. 
However, if you want to reach an even wider audience, considering that in most developing countries education is precarious and a significant part of the potential audience does not speak English, I suggest:
1. To associate the subtitles, even if in English, as this would allow those who do not master the language to provide the translation of the entire text or parts of them not well understood precisely by the lack of mastery;
2. That the narrator speaks in a more leisurely way, as this would also benefit the audience that has not yet mastered the language.
Thanks for the attention, thanks for the video and I wish all success to the Simplilearn team!",1
Lot of respect sir🙏 can't thank you enough for these live sessions.,1
"Sir, a lot of respect to you, Excellent session :)",1
Superb sir i thoroughly enjoyed of learning machine learning. Your energy and practical way of teaching makes more eagerness towards learning data science,1
Sir thank you for this great job. Please sir i have a question? Are we to always assume theta one while finding the gradient descent curve? Thank you so much. I love the way you split everything for us. You are so much.,1
"Amazing explanation,  I loved the way you taught . ❤",1
Thank you sir for such amazing community classes,1
Excellent 1st session. Excited to do the 2nd part tomorrow. I am trying to revise my ML knowledge to get back to competing in Kaggle.,1
Idk if you realise the intensity of positive impact you are making in many people's life. Thank you so much sir for what you're doing 🙏❤️.,1
"Excellent resource Sir!
Can you please explain all the sub fields in AI/ ML/ DL like NLP, computer vision etc. & any other major part that I don't know even. 

In software engineering we have specialized paths for different types of engineers. Like for web development frontend technologies are same html, css, js. For backend one may choose a programming language (php, node js, asp.net) and a database. 
Again for mobile developers they may choose Android, IOS or cross platform (React native, flutter) with database knowledge, APIs & basic knowledge on how web works.

My question is in software engineering one may become a very good software engineer even he only concentrates on web or mobile dev, can an AI/ ML engineer pick his career in his filed of specialization like only NLP engineer (knows very less about Computer Vision) or Computer Vision engineer (knows very less about NLP)?",1
All I want to say that you are a blessing and I commend your dedication and effort. Even coming from a PhD in computer engineering your materials have helped me a lot. I wish you the best in all your endeavors.,1
"Hey there! 
Firstly, I can't thank you enough for starting this channel ❤️
I'm here after I saw your video about how to pick up the basic skills to become a data analyst in 3 months video and want to let you know that I had started the Google data analytics course on Coursera about 45 days ago and have finished 2 courses in the certificate series. Do you think it is possible for me to pick up the same skills you mentioned in your video through this course? 
Do you think the Google badge on the certificate might give it an edge?
I honestly feel the pathway you described in your video takes a more in depth approach which might be beneficial. 
Would really really love to hear your thoughts on this.
It would really mean a lot if you replied.
Thank you.",1
"Thank you so much for all that you do sir, they are extremely helpful!",1
Thanks for your time and effort. The way you have designed and presented is awesome.  You made many people's life easier. Thanks again.,1
"This channel is such a blessing and a goldmine of quality content!!

Also, loved the soothing background music!!",1
"In my eyes, the second con is the worst thing that can happen to you in ml. In many cases I would eagerly wait for about 5-6 hours for the model to train, to see it not work at all in the way I intended. I'd keep training the model day after day after making small changes in the  code to see its performance not getting better at all.",0
"Tim always posts videos on topics that I am currently practicing/have in mind. These coincidences happens so much, its scary lol. 

Love your vids 👍",1
"I'm a data scientist and 95% of my job is data collection and preparation, it's still a cool job but it's not all model development",1
"The only thing holding me back is that it took about 30 mins to implement a classification algorithm with a data size of around 20 numbers on a powerful laptop. It was straightforward and a lot of fun but when the size of the data increases, it might go on for even a week with GPUs. It pays well but so does frontend development at any decent company. This video didn't give any valuable inputs to make a decision",0
Tim you should post more about machine Learning. Also please try to make a video on how to use the model for production. It will be really helpful!,1
"Me resultó tan inspirador conocerte, Haydé! Me estoy amigando con las matemáticas para poder profundizar más en estos temas :)",1
"Excelente explicación Haydé, conceptualmente logré relacionar el machine learning con mi carrera.  Gracias a ti, a tu mamá y a tu tía ;) ""No entiendes realmente algo a menos que seas capaz de explicárselo a tu abuela"" A. Einstein.",1
"Esta chica es estupenda, mis elogios para ella. Sin duda alguna necesitamos mas personas así en Latinoamerica. :)",1
"Qué charla tan genial e inspiradora. Yo también soy desarrolladora y estoy empezando en este área para mi tesis y me ha motivado un montón ver a alguien que ya está en el tema y que le augura un futuro tan prometedor!  Además, estoy totalmente de acuerdo contigo: el esfuerzo nunca traiciona y estudiar es el catalizador más eficiente para lograr el éxito. Gracias por haber subido el vídeo!",1
"Muchas gracias Haydé por tu plática. Me inspiró muchísimo. Actualmente trabajo en USA como arquitecto de sistemas y le he puesto muchas pausas el empezar a aprender algo de machine learning. Me genera inseguridad el hecho de que en la escuela no me fue muy bien en las matemáticas, sin embargo como tú dices es solo cuestión de entrenarse y entrenarse. Muchas gracias!!!",1
uuyyyy gracias por compartir tu experiencia que va a ser de inspiración para mi vida: Soy estudiante de ingeniería electrónica de quinto semestre y con estas historias mi motivación crece para ser ingeniero que haga cosas grandiosas y no ser del montón. GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS......,1

I have a PhD in AI and I can say that Andrew is THE BEST machine learning/AI educator I have ever seen on the field! The deeplearning specialization is just invaluable for any interested learner in DL.,1
One of the people that inspired me to do artificial intelligence in areas that matter. Without Coursera I would have not gotten where I am today. Thank you for this conversation Lex!,1
"Whenever someone uses the word ""It turns out"", I remember Andrew Ng. I love Andrew Ng.",1
"“when someone else allowed me the good fortune of helping them a little bit”...It's a great time to be alive when people like you, Lex, and Andrew share your knowledge with the world simply to help them ""a little bit"".  I believe the little bits will make the world a better place.",1
"As a GenX'er I enjoyed this interview so much. It made me actually feel like I was experiencing the internet we were promised decades ago. A well thought out and intelligent conversation that, in the end, leaves the viewer in a state better than when they first pressed the play button. Well done.",1
"I took Ng's class on Coursera years ago. It switched my career trajectory from academic to industry, and spurred my interest in making things. Awesome to see this interview!",1
This man got a great voiceover career available at anytime.,1
"This week has been awesome! First Scott Aaronson and now Andrew Ng :).

Lex, it'd be really cool if you could get someone working on the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning, like Sanjeev Arora, Ankur Moitra or Costis Daskalakis... It'd be super interesting to see the conversation between experts on two different sides of the same coin; applied and theoretical.",1
Im a physician from Brazil learning ai and this fine man helped me a lot thank you sir I salute you,1
"Machine learning is an incredibly powerful numerical tool. Man, I love how far we've come technologically!",1
"You have the best way to describe what Machine Learning is. I was wondering what its real meaning and I then found your answer in video. 
I recommend all who don't know the meaning to see this video.
Thanks Oxford.",1
"Great introduction. Question: is it always the case that humans need to input the potential features that are used for classification? For instance, the ML algorithm uses the animal's height, length, and face size as features for classification, with computer vision being used to map images to these features. Do some ML algorithms create these features and features maps automatically, or are these always created outside of the algorithm? 

PS: What did you use to create this video, it looks great :)",1
"I love the way you explained, plus the diversity :)",1
"AI is already here, and that is not such a bad thing. Can computers become self aware? Yes I think so in the not too distant future.",1
Best explanation of machine learning🔥🔥,1
Awesome! Succinct :-) Very effective for a newbie to understand the concept:-),1
well explanation. love it,1
Great animation.keep it up.,1
*Thanks for sharing what is machine learning using such good animation*,1
"I am currently enrolled in a MSc Machine learning masters here in the UK, and we are learning both the theory and putting it into practice using the assignments. There really isn't a problem of doing it both. Stop telling yourself you can't.. If you put in the time and effort with the right learning mindset and method, you can learn to eat and drink at the same time. Just need to be smart about it. Stop putting these limiting thoughts on yourself. It really isn't that hard.",1
"I came for a machine learning related talk but I got a life lesson, thanks Daniel nice content! 

PS: I was thinking about going into ML field but I now realized it's due to engineer disease. I'm sticking with web apps at least for some time until I can decide what I love and what I don't.",1
"I've worked for about 2 years with ML/computer vision and a lot of the things in this video resonated. When I started out I was frustrated that I couldn't dive directly into designing new advanced mathematical models right away but I realized there are a lot of ""boring"" things that need to be in place before that's even relevant (data curation, annotation, testing frameworks etc just to name a few). There are a lot of interesting problems to solve along the way that I probably wouldn't even realize existed if I stayed in academia for a PhD. 

I think there is a point to be made for switching back and forth between learning ""tools for the sake of tools"" and solving problems though. As long as you spend enough effort to make some progress each time it can really help keeping things fresh",1
"I come from a physics background, and usually we spend a lot of time concerning with theory, trying to enrich our theoretical knowledge as much as we can. A lot of colleagues in my department don't understand that trying to learn everything is an infinite loop. During my masters I realized how important is to just start doing things with curiosity, which led me to collaborate in two amazing projects. Now that I'm finishing my masters and starting to get into ML engineering I see how this mindset is even more crucial to let you accomplish the things you want. Amazing content you put there, mate! Thanks from Brazil!",1
I really like the point about engineering toolboxes. I think that’s where a lot of the burnout comes from. I work in DevOps and teach full stack so going to school for machine learning sounds like a large leap. Learning how to build better ML pipelines are much more worth my time.,1
I’ve just started exploring this field. And this was a really good reminder to get so early on the journey. Thanks a lot!,1
"Hey Daniel, just discovered your channel a couple days ago and I'm learning lots. Thank you!",1
"This is great. Focus is key. A playful approach can also speed things up depending on how you learn and of course patience. For those interested in R and python, the latest R studio IDE is great and allows you to run both side by side with reticulate. It can seem a steep curve but those with a grounding in R and statistics you can run ML scripts side by side and learn the similarities and where they differ.",1
